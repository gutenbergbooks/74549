LA MORTE AMOREUSE
</h3>

<p class="t3">
BY THEOPHILE GAUTIER
</p>

<p class="intro">
<i>Theophile Gautier (born 1811, died 1872)
began life as a painter, turned to poetry and
finally adopted prose forms for the expression
of his ideas.  Always an enthusiastic apostle
of romanticism, he lived in an atmosphere of
Oriental splendor.  His style is unusually rich
and sensuous, and has exerted a considerable
influence on the present generation of writers.</i>

LA MORTE AMOREUSE
</p>

<p class="t3">
THÉOPHILE GAUTIER
</p>

<p>
Have I ever loved, you ask me, my brother?  Yes,
I have loved!  The story is dread and marvelous,
and, for all my threescore years, I scarce dare stir
the ashes of that memory.  To you I can refuse
nothing; to a heart less steeled than yours this tale could
never be told by me.  For these things were so strange that
I can scarce believe they came into my own existence.  Three
long years was I the puppet of a delusion of the devil.
Three long years was I a parish priest by day, while by
night, in dreams (God grant they were but dreams!), I led
the life of a child of this world, of a lost soul!  For one
kind glance at a woman's face was my spirit to be doomed;
but at length, with God to aid and my patron saint, it was
given to me to drive away the evil spirit that possessed me.
</p>

<p>
I lived a double life, by night and by day.  All day long
was I a pure priest of the Lord, concerned only with prayer
and holy things; but no sooner did I close my eyes in sleep
than I was a young knight, a lover of women, of horses, of
hounds, a drinker, a dicer, a blasphemer, and, when I woke
at dawn, meseemed that I was fallen on sleep, and did but
dream that I was a priest.  For those years of dreaming
certain memories yet remain with me; memories of words and
things that will not down.  Ay, though I have never left the
walls of my vicarage, he who heard me would rather take
me for one that had lived in the world and left it, to die
in religion, and end in the breast of God his tumultuous
days, than for a priest grown old in a forgotten curé, deep
in a wood, and far from the things of this earth.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I have loved as never man loved, with a wild love
and a terrible, so that I marvel my heart did not burst in
twain.  Oh, the nights of long ago!
</p>

<p>
From my earliest childhood had I felt the call to be a
priest.  This was the end of all my studies, and, till I was
twenty-four, my days were one long training.  My theological
course achieved, I took the lesser orders, and at length,
at the end of Holy Week, was to be the hour of my ordination.
</p>

<p>
I had never entered the world; my world was the college
close.  Vaguely I knew that woman existed, but of woman
I never thought.  My heart was wholly pure.  Even my old
and infirm mother I saw but twice a year; of other worldly
relations I had none.
</p>

<p>
I had no regrets and no hesitation in taking the
irrevocable vow; nay, I was full of an impatient joy.  Never
did a young bridegroom so eagerly count the hours of his
wedding.  In my broken sleep I dreamed of saying the
Mass.  To be a priest seemed to me the noblest thing in
the world, and I would have disdained the estate of poet or
of king.  To be a priest!  My ambition saw nothing higher.
</p>

<p>
All this I tell you that you may know how little I
deserve that which befell me; that you may know how
inexplicable was the fascination by which I was overcome.
</p>

<p>
The great day came, and I walked to church as if I were
winged or trod on air.  I felt an angelic beatitude, and
marveled at the gloomy and thoughtful faces of my companions,
for we were many.  The night I had passed in prayer.  I
was all but entranced in ecstasy.  The bishop, a venerable
old man, was in my eyes like God the Father bowed above
His own eternity, and I seemed to see heaven open beyond
the arches of the minster.
</p>

<p>
You know the ceremony: the Benediction, the Communion
in both kinds, the anointing of the palms of the
hands with consecrated oil, and finally the celebration of the
Holy Rite, offered up in company with the bishop.  On these
things I will not linger, but oh, how true is the word of Job,
that he is foolish who maketh not a covenant with his eyes!
I chanced to raise my head and saw before me, so near that
it seemed I could touch her, though in reality she was at
some distance, and on the farther side of the railing, a young
dame royally clad, and of incomparable beauty.
</p>

<p>
It was as if scales had fallen from my eyes; and I felt
like a blind man who suddenly recovers his sight.  The
bishop, so splendid a moment ago, seemed to fade; through
all the church was darkness, and the candles paled in their
sconces of gold, like stars at dawn.  Against the gloom that
lovely thing shone out like a heavenly revelation, seeming
herself to be the fountain of light, and to give it rather than
receive it.  I cast down my eyes, vowing that I would not
raise them again; my attention was failing, and I scarce knew
what I did.  The moment afterward, I opened my eyes, for
through my eyelids I saw her glittering in a bright penumbra,
as when one has stared at the sun.  Ah! how beautiful she
was!  The greatest painters, when they have sought in heaven
for ideal beauty, and have brought to earth the portrait of
our Lady, come never near the glory of this vision!  Pen of
poet, or palette of painter, can give no idea of her.  She was
tall, with the carriage of a goddess; her fair hair flowed about
her brows in rivers of gold.  Like a crowned queen she stood
there, with her broad white brow, and dark eyebrows; with
her eyes that had the brightness and life of the green sea,
and at one glance made or marred the destiny of a man.
They were astonishingly clear and brilliant, shooting rays like
arrows, which I could actually see winging straight for my
heart.  I know not if the flame that lighted them came from
heaven or hell, but from one or other assuredly it came.
</p>

<p>
Angel or devil, or both; this woman was no child of Eve,
the mother of us all.  White teeth shone in her smile, little
dimples came and went with each movement of her mouth,
among the roses of her cheeks.  There was a lustre as of
agate on the smooth and shining skin of her half-clad shoulders,
and chains of great pearls no whiter than her neck fell
over her breast.  From time to time she lifted her head in
snake-like motion, and set the silvery ruffles of her raiment
quivering.  She wore a flame-colored velvet robe, and from
the ermine lining of her sleeves her delicate hands came and
went as transparent as the fingers of the dawn.  As I gazed
on her, I felt within me as it were the opening of gates that
had ever been barred; I saw sudden vistas of an unknown
future; all life seemed altered, new thoughts wakened in my
heart.  A horrible pain took possession of me; each minute
seemed at once a moment and an age.  The ceremony went
on and on, and I was being carried far from the world, at
whose gates my new desires were beating.  I said "Yes,"
when I wished to say "No," when my whole soul protested
against the words my tongue was uttering.  A hidden force
seemed to drag them from me.  This it is perhaps which
makes so many young girls walk to the altar with the firm
resolve to refuse the husband who is forced on them, and this
is why not one of them does what she intends.  This is why
so many poor novices take the veil, though they are determined
to tear it into shreds, rather than pronounce the vows.
None dares cause so great a scandal before so many observers,
nor thus betray such general expectation.  The will of
all imposes itself on you; the gaze of all weighs upon you like
a cope of lead.  And again, all is so clearly arranged in
advance, so evidently irrevocable, that the intention of refusal
is crushed, and disappears.
</p>

<p>
The expression of the unknown beauty changed as the
ceremony advanced.  Tender and caressing at first, it became
contemptuous and disdainful.  With an effort that might have
moved a mountain, I strove to cry out that I would never
be a priest; it was in vain; my tongue clave to the roof of my
mouth; I could not refuse even by a sign.  Though wide
awake, I seemed to be in one of those nightmares, wherein
for your life you can not utter the word on which your life
depends.  She appeared to understand the torture which I
endured, and cast on me a glance of divine pity and divine
promise.  "Be mine," she seemed to say, "and I shall make
thee happier than God and heaven, and His angels will be
jealous of thee.  Tear that shroud of death wherein thou art
swathed, for I am beauty, and I am youth, and I am life;
come to me and we shall be love.  What can Jehovah offer
thee in exchange for thy youth?  Our life will flow like a
dream in the eternity of a kiss.  Spill but the wine from that
chalice, and thou are free, and I will carry thee to the
unknown isles, and thou shalt sleep on my breast in a bed of
gold beneath a canopy of silver, for I love thee and would
fain take thee from thy God, before whom so many noble
hearts pour forth the incense of their love, which dies before
it reaches the heaven where He dwells."  These words I
seemed to hear singing in the sweetest of tunes, for there was
a music in her look, and the words which her eyes sent to me
resounded in my heart as if they had been whispered in my
soul.  I was ready to foreswear God, and yet I went duly
through each rite of the ceremony.  She cast me a second
glance, so full of entreaty and despair, that I felt more
swords pierce my breast than stabbed the heart of our Lady
of Sorrows.
</p>

<p>
It was over, and I was a priest.
</p>

<p>
Then never did human face declare so keen a sorrow: the
girl who sees her betrothed fall dead at her side, the mother
by the empty cradle of her child, Eve at the gate of Paradise,
the miser who seeks his treasure and finds a stone, even they
look less sorely smitten, less inconsolable.
</p>

<p>
The blood left her fair face pale, white as marble she
seemed; her lovely arms fell powerless, her feet failed
beneath her, and she leaned against a pillar of the church.
For me, I staggered to the door, with a white, wet face,
breathless, with all the weight of all the dome upon my head.
As I was crossing the threshold, a hand seized mine, a
woman's hand.  I had never felt before a woman's hand in
mine.  It was cold as the skin of a serpent, yet it burned me
like a brand.  "Miserable man, what hast thou done?" she
whispered, and was lost in the crowd.
</p>

<p>
The old bishop paused, and gazed severely at me, who
was a piteous spectacle, now red, now pale, giddy, and faint.
One of my fellows had compassion on me, and led me home.
I could not have found the way alone.  At the corner of a
street, while the young priest's head was turned, a black
page, strangely clad, came up to me, and gave me, as he
passed, a little leathern case, with corners of wrought gold,
signing me to hide it.  I thrust it into my sleeve, and there
kept it till I was alone in my cell.  Then I opened the clasp;
there were but these words written: "Clarimonde, at the
Palazzo Concini."  So little of a worldling was I, that I had
never heard of Clarimonde, despite her fame, nay, nor knew
where the Palazzo Concini might be.  I made a myriad
guesses, each wilder than the other; but, truth to tell, so I
did but see her again, I recked little whether Clarimonde
were a noble lady, or no better than one of the wicked.
</p>

<p>
This love, thus born in an hour, had struck root too deep
for me to dream of casting it from my heart.  This woman
had made me utterly her own, a glance had been enough to
change me, her will had passed upon me; I lived not for
myself, but in her and for her.
</p>

<p>
Many mad things did I, kissing my hand where hers had
touched it, repeating her name for hours: Clarimonde,
Clarimonde!  I had but to close my eyes, and I saw her as
distinctly as if she had been present.  Then I murmured to
myself the words that beneath the church porch she had spoken:
"Miserable man, what hast thou done?"  I felt all the horror
of that strait wherein I was, and the dead and terrible aspect
of the life that I had chosen was now revealed.  To be a
priest!  Never to love, to know youth nor sex, to turn from
beauty, to close the eyes, to crawl in the chill shade of a
cloister or a church; to see none but deathly men, to watch
by the nameless corpses of folk unknown, to wear a cassock
like my own mourning for myself, my own raiment for my
coffin's pall.
</p>

<p>
Then life arose in me like a lake in flood, my blood
coursed in my veins, my youth burst forth in a moment; like
the aloe, which flowers but once in a hundred years, and
breaks into blossom with a sound of thunder!
</p>

<p>
How was I again to have sight of Clarimonde?  I had
no excuse for leaving the seminary, for I knew nobody in
town, and indeed was only waiting till I should be appointed
to my parish.  I tried to remove the bars of the window, but
to descend without a ladder was impossible.  Then, again, I
could only escape by night, when I should be lost in the
labyrinth of streets.  These difficulties, which would have
been nothing to others, were enormous to a poor priest like
me, now first fallen in love, without experience, or money,
or knowledge of the world.
</p>

<p>
Ah, had I not been a priest I might have seen her every
day, I might have been her lover, her husband, I said to
myself in the blindness of my heart.  In place of being swathed
in a cassock I might have worn silk and velvet, chains of
gold, a sword and feather like all the fair young knights.
My locks would not be tonsured, but would fall in perfumed
curls about my neck.  But one hour spent before an altar,
and some gabbled words, had cut me off from the company
of the living.  With my own hand I had sealed the stone
upon my tomb, and turned the key in the lock of my
prison!
</p>

<p>
I walked to the window.  The sky was heavenly blue, the
trees had clothed them in the raiment of spring, all nature
smiled with mockery in her smile.  The square was full of
people coming and going: young exquisites, young beauties,
two by two, were walking in the direction of the gardens.
Workmen sang drinking songs as they passed; on all sides
were a life, a movement, a gaiety that did but increase my
sorrow and my solitude.  A young mother, on the steps of
the gate, was playing with her child, kissing its little rosy
mouth, with a thousand of the caresses, the childlike and the
divine caresses that are the secret of mothers.  Hard by the
father, with folded arms above a happy heart, smiled sweetly
as he watched them.  I could not endure the sight.  I shut
the window, and threw myself on the bed in a horrible
jealousy and hatred, so that I gnawed my fingers and my
coverlet like a starved wild beast.
</p>

<p>
How many days I lay thus I know not, but at last, as I
turned in a spasm of rage, I saw the Abbé Sérapion curiously
considering me.  I bowed my head in shame, and hid my face
with my hands.  "Romuald, my friend," said he, "some
strange thing hath befallen thee.  Satan hath desired to have
thee, that he may sift thee like wheat; he goeth about thee
to devour thee like a raging lion.  Beware and make thyself
a breastplate of prayer, a shield of the mortifying of the flesh.
Fight, and thou shalt overcome.  Be not afraid with any
discouragement, for the firmest hearts and the most surely
guarded have known hours like these.  Pray, fast, meditate,
and the evil spirit will pass away from thee."
</p>

<p>
Then Sérapion told me that the priest of C&mdash;&mdash; was dead,
that the bishop had appointed me to this charge, and that I
must be ready by the morrow.  I nodded assent, and the
Abbé departed.  I opened my missal and strove to read in
it, but the lines waved confusedly, and the volume slipped
unheeded from my hands.
</p>

<p>
Next day Sérapion came for me; two mules were waiting
for us at the gate with our slender baggage, and we mounted
as well as we might.  As we traversed the streets I looked
for Clarimonde, in each balcony, at every window; but it was
too early, and the city was yet asleep.  When we had passed
the gates, and were climbing the height, I turned back for a
last glance at the place that was the home of Clarimonde.
The shadow of a cloud lay on the city, the red roofs and the
blue were mingled in a mist, whence rose here and there
white puffs of smoke.  By some strange optical effect, one
house stood up, golden in a ray of light, far above the roofs
that were mingled in the mist.  A league away though it
was, it seemed quite close to us&mdash;all was plain to see,
turrets, balconies, parapets, the very weathercocks.
</p>

<p>
"What is that palace we see yonder in the sunlight?"
said I to Sérapion.
</p>

<p>
He shaded his eyes with his hand, looked, and answered:
</p>

<p>
"That is the old palace which Prince Concini has
given to Clarimonde the harlot.  Therein dreadful things
are done."
</p>

<p>
Even at that moment, whether it were real or a vision
I know not now, methought I saw a white and slender shape
come across the terrace, glance, and disappear.  It was
Clarimonde!
</p>

<p>
Ah, did she know how in that hour, at the height of the
rugged way which led me from her, even at the crest of the
path I should never tread again, I was watching her, eager
and restless, watching the palace where she dwelt, and which
a freak of light and shadow seemed to bring near me, as if
inviting me to enter and be lord of all?  Doubtless she knew
it, so closely bound was her heart to mine; and this it was
which had urged her, in the raiment of the night, to climb
the palace terrace in the frosty dews of dawn.
</p>

<p>
The shadow slipped over the palace, and, anon, there was
but a motionless sea of roofs, marked merely by a billowy
undulation of forms.  Sérapion pricked on his mule, mine
also quickened, and a winding of the road hid from me
forever the city of S&mdash;&mdash;, where I was to return no more.  At
the end of three days' journey through melancholy fields, we
saw the weathercock of my parish church peeping above the
trees.  Some winding lanes, bordered by cottages and
gardens, brought us to the building, which was of no great
splendor.  A porch with a few moldings, and two or three
pillars rudely carved in sandstone, a tiled roof with counter-forts
of the same stone as the pillars&mdash;that was all.  To the
left was the graveyard, deep in tall grasses, with an iron
cross in the centre.  The priest's house was to the right, in
the shadow of the church.  Simplicity could not be more
simple, nor cleanliness less lovely.  Some chickens were
pecking at a few grains of oats on the ground as we entered.
The sight of a priest's frock seemed too familiar to alarm
them, and they scarcely moved to let us pass.  Then we
heard a hoarse and wheezy bark, and an old dog ran up to
greet us.  He was the dog of the late priest&mdash;dim-eyed, gray,
with every sign of a dog's extreme old age.  I patted him
gently, and he walked along by my side with an air of
inexpressible satisfaction.  An elderly woman, my predecessor's
housekeeper, came in her turn to greet us; and when she
learned that I meant to keep her in my service, to keep the
dog and the chickens, with all the furniture that her master
had left her at his death&mdash;above all, when the Abbé Sérapion
paid what she asked on the spot&mdash;her joy knew no
bounds.
</p>

<p>
When I had been duly installed, Sérapion returned to the
college, and I was left alone.  Unsupported, uncomforted as
I was, the thought of Clarimonde again beset me, nor could I
drive her memory away for all my efforts.  One evening, as
I walked among the box-lined paths of my little garden, I
fancied that I saw among the trees the form of a woman,
who followed all my movements, and whose green eyes
glistened through the leaves.  Green as the sea shone her
eyes, but it was no more than a vision, for when I crossed to
the other side of the alley nothing did I find but the print
of a little foot on the sand&mdash;a foot like the foot of a child.
Now the garden was girt with high walls, and, for all my
search, I could find no living thing within them.  I have
never been able to explain this incident, which, after all,
was nothing to the strange adventures that were to follow.
</p>

<p>
Thus did I live for a whole year, fulfilling every duty of
the priesthood&mdash;preaching, praying, fasting, visiting the sick,
denying myself necessaries that I might give to the poor.
But within me all was dry and barren&mdash;the fountains of grace
were sealed.  I knew not the happiness which goes with the
consciousness of a holy mission fulfilled.  My heart was
otherwhere; the words of Clarimonde dwelt on my lips like
the ballad burden a man repeats against his will.  Oh, my
brother, consider this!  For the lifting up of mine eyes to
behold a woman have I been harried these many years, and
my life hath been troubled forever.
</p>

<p>
I shall not hold you longer with the story of these defeats
and these victories and the fresh defeats of my soul; let
me come to the beginning of the new life.
</p>

<p>
One night there was a violent knocking at my gate.  The
old housekeeper went to open it, and the appearance of a
man richly clad in an outlandish fashion, tawny of hue,
armed with a long dagger, stood before her in the light of
her lantern.  She was terrified, but he soothed her, saying
that he needs must see me instantly concerning a matter of
my ministry.  Barbara brought him upstairs to the room
where I was about going to bed.  There the man told me
that his mistress, a lady of high degree, was on the point
of death, and desired to see a priest.  I answered that I was
ready to follow him, and taking with me such matters as are
needful for extreme unction, I went down hastily.  At the
door were two horses, black as night, their breath rising in
white clouds of vapor.  The man held my stirrup while I
mounted; then he laid one hand on the pommel and vaulted
on the other horse.  Gripping his beast with his knees, he
gave him his head, and we started with the speed of an
arrow, my horse keeping pace with his own.  We seemed in
running to devour the way; the earth flitted gray beneath us,
the black trees fled in the darkness like an army in rout.  A
forest we crossed, so gloomy and so frozen cold that I felt
in all my veins a shudder of superstitious dread.  The sparks
struck from the flints by our coursers' feet followed after
us like a trail of fire, and whoever saw us must have deemed
us two ghosts riding the nightmare.  Will-o'-the-wisps glittered
across our path, the night birds clamored in the forest
deeps, and now and again shone out the burning eyes of
wild-cats.
</p>

<p>
The manes of the horses tossed more wildly on the wind,
the sweat ran down their sides, their breath came thick and
loud.  But whenever they slackened, the groom called on
them with a cry like nothing that ever came from a human
throat, and again they ran their furious course.  At last the
tempest of their flight reached its goal; suddenly there
stood before us a great dark mass, with shining points of
flame.  Our horses' hoofs clattered louder on a drawbridge,
and we thundered through the dark depths of a vaulted
entrance which gaped between two monstrous towers.
Within the castle all was confusion&mdash;servants with burning
torches ran hither and thither through the courts; on the
staircases lights rose and fell.  I beheld a medley of vast
buildings, columns, arches, parapet and balcony&mdash;a bewildering
world of royal or of fairy palaces.  The negro page
who had given me the tablets of Clarimonde, and whom I
recognized at a glance, helped me to alight.  A seneschal in
black velvet, with a golden chain about his neck, and an
ivory wand in his hand, came forward to meet me, great
tears rolling down his cheeks to his snowy beard.
</p>

<p>
"Too late," he said; "too late, sir priest!  But if thou hast
not come in time to save the soul, watch, I pray thee, with
the unhappy body of the dead."
</p>

<p>
He took me by the arm; he led me to the hall, where
the corpse was lying, and I wept as bitterly as he, deeming
that the dead was Clarimonde, the well and wildly loved.
There stood a prie-dieu by the bed; a blue flame flickering
from a cup of bronze cast all about the chamber a doubtful
light, and here and there set the shadows fluttering.  In a
chiseled vase on the table was one white rose faded, a
single petal clinging to the stem; the rest had fallen like
fragrant tears and lay beside the vase.  A broken mask, a
fan, masquerading gear of every kind were huddled on the
chairs, and showed that death had come, unlooked for and
unheralded, to that splendid house.  Not daring to cast
mine eyes upon the bed, I kneeled, and fervently began to
repeat the Psalms, thanking God that between this woman
and me He had set the tomb, so that now her name might
come like a thing enskied and sainted in my prayers.
</p>

<p>
By degrees this ardor slackened, and I fell a-dreaming.
This chamber, after all, had none of the air of a chamber
of death.  In place of the fetid, corpse-laden atmosphere that
I was wont to breathe in these vigils, there floated gently
through the warmth a vapor of Orient essences, a perfume
of women and of love.  The pale glimmer of the lamp
seemed rather the twilight of pleasure than the yellow burning
of the taper that watches by the dead.  I began to think
of the rare hazard that brought me to Clarimonde in the
moment when I had lost her forever, and a sigh came
from my breast.  Then meseemed that one answered with a
sigh behind me, and I turned unconsciously.  'Twas but an
echo, but, as I turned, mine eyes fell on that which they
had shunned&mdash;the bed where Clarimonde lay in state.  The
flowered and crimson curtains, bound up with loops of gold,
left the dead woman plain to view, lying at her length, with
hands folded on her breast.  She was covered with a linen
veil, very white and glistening, the more by reason of the
dark purple hangings, and so fine was the shroud that her
fair body shone through it, with those beautiful soft waving
lines, as of the swan's neck, that not even death could harden.
Fair she was as a statue of alabaster carved by some skilled
man for the tomb of a queen; fair as a young maid asleep
beneath new-fallen snow.
</p>

<p>
I could endure no longer.  The air as of a bower of love,
the scent of the faded rose intoxicated me, and I strode
through the chamber, stopping at each turn to gaze at the
beautiful dead beneath the transparent shroud.  Strange
thoughts haunted my brain.  I fancied that she was not
really gone, that it was but a device to draw me within her
castle gates, and to tell me all her love.
</p>

<p>
Nay, one moment methought I saw her foot stir beneath
its white swathings, and break the stiff lines of the shroud.
</p>

<p>
"Is she really Clarimonde?" I asked myself presently.
"What proof have I?  The black page may have entered the
household of some other lady.  Mad must I be thus to
disquiet myself."
</p>

<p>
But the beating of my own heart answered me, "It is she!
It is she!"
</p>

<p>
I drew near the bed, and looked with fresh attention at
that which thus perplexed me.  Shall I confess it?  The
perfection of her beauty, though shadowed and sanctified
by death, troubled my heart, and that long rest of hers was
wondrous like a living woman's sleep.  I forgot that I had
come there to watch by a corpse, and I dreamed that I was
a young bridegroom entering the chamber of the veiled,
half-hidden bride.  Broken with sorrow, wild with joy,
shuddering with dread and desire, I stooped toward the dead and
raised a corner of the sheet.  Gently I raised it, holding
my breath as though I feared to waken her.  My blood
coursed so vehemently that I heard it rushing and surging
through the veins of my temples.  My brow was dank with
drops of sweat, as if I had lifted no film of linen, but a
weighty gravestone of marble.
</p>

<p>
There lay Clarimonde, even as I had seen her on the day
of mine ordination; even so delightful was she, and death
in Clarimonde seemed but a wilful charm.  The pallor of
her cheeks, her dead lips fading rose, her long downcast
eyelids, with their brown lashes, breaking the marble of her
cheek, all gave her an air of melancholy, and of purity, of
pensive patience that had an inexpressible winning magic.
Her long loose hair, the small blue flowers yet scattered
through it, pillowed her head, and veiled the splendor of her
shoulders.  Her fair hands, clear and pure as the consecrated
wafer, were crossed in an attitude of holy rest and
silent prayer, that suffered not the exquisite roundness and
ivory polish of her pearled arms to prove, even in death, too
triumphant a lure of men.
</p>

<p>
Long did I wait and watch her silently, and still the more
I gazed, the less I could deem that life had left forever her
beautiful body.  I knew not if it were an illusion, or a
reflection from the lamp, but it was as if the blood began to flow
again beneath that dead white of her flesh, and yet she lay
eternally, immovably still.  I touched her arm; it was cold,
but no colder than her hand had been on the day when it
met mine beneath the church porch.  I fell into my old
attitude, stooping my face above her face, while down upon
her rained the warm dew of my tears.  Oh, bitterness of
impotence and of despair; oh, wild agony of that death
watch!
</p>

<p>
The night crept on, and as I felt that the eternal separation
drew near, I could not deny myself the sad last delight
of one kiss on the dead lips that held all my love.
</p>

<p>
Oh, miracle!  A light breath mingled with my breath,
and the mouth of Clarimonde answered to the touch of
mine!  Her eyes opened, and softly shone.  She sighed, she
uncrossed her arms, and, folding them about my neck in a
ravished ecstasy:
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Romuald, it is thou!" she said in a voice as sweet
and languishing as the last tremblings of a lyre.  "Ah,
Romuald, what makest thou here?  So long have I waited for
thee that I am dead.  Yet now we are betrothed, now I
may see thee, and visit thee.  Farewell, Romuald, farewell!
I love thee.  It is all that I had to tell thee, and I give thee
again that life which thou gavest me with thy kiss.  Soon
shall we meet again."
</p>

<p>
Her head sank down, but still her arms clung to me as if
they would hold me forever.  A wild gust of wind burst
open the window and broke into the room.  The last leaf
of the white rose fluttered like a bird's wing on the stem,
and then fell and flew through the open casement, bearing
with it the soul of Clarimonde.
</p>

<p>
The lamp went out, and I fell fainting on the breast of
the beautiful corpse.
</p>

<p>
When I came to myself I was lying on my own bed in
the little chamber of the priest's house; my hand had slipped
from beneath the coverlet, the old dog was licking it.
Barbara hobbled and trembled about the room, opening and
shutting drawers, and shaking powders into glasses.  The
old woman gave a cry of delight when she saw me open my
eyes.  The dog yelped and wagged his tail, but I was too
weak to utter a word or make the slightest movement.
Later, I learned that for three days I had lain thus, with
no sign of life but a scarce perceptible breathing.  These
three days do not count in my life; I know not where my
spirit went wandering all that time, whereof I keep not the
slightest memory.  Barbara told me that the same bronzed
man who had come for me at night brought me back in a
closed litter next morning, and instantly went his way.  So
soon as I could recall my thoughts, I reviewed each incident
of that fatal night.  At first I deemed that I had been
duped by art magic, but presently actual, palpable circumstances
destroyed that belief.  I could not suppose that I
had been dreaming, for Barbara, no less than myself, had
seen the man with the two coal-black steeds, and she
described them accurately.  Yet no one knew of any castle in
the neighborhood at all like that in which I had found
Clarimonde again.
</p>

<p>
One morning Sérapion entered my room; he had come
with all haste in answer to Barbara's message about my
illness.  Though this declared his affection for me, none the
more did his visit give me pleasure.  There was something
inquisitive and piercing to my mind in the very glance of
Sérapion, and I felt like a criminal in his presence.  He it
was who first discovered my secret disquiet, and I bore him
a grudge for being so clear-sighted.
</p>

<p>
While he was asking about my health, in accents of
honeyed hypocrisy, his eyes, as yellow as a lion's, were
sounding the depths of my soul.  Presently&mdash;"The famous
harlot Clarimonde is dead," says he, in a piercing tone, "dead
at the close of an eight days' revel.  It was a feast of
Belshazzar or of Cleopatra.  Good God, what an age is ours!  The
guests were served by dusky slaves who spoke no tongue
known among men, and who seemed like spirits from the
pit.  The livery of the least of them might have beseemed
an emperor on a coronation day.  Wild tales are told of
this same Clarimonde, and all her loves have perished
miserably or by violence.  They say she was a ghost, a female
vampire, but I believe she was the devil himself."
</p>

<p>
He paused, watching me, who could not master a sudden
movement at the name of Clarimonde.
</p>

<p>
"Satan's claw is long," said Sérapion, with a stern glance,
"and tombs ere now have given up their dead.  Threefold
should be the seal upon the grave of Clarimonde, for this
is not, men say, the first time she hath died.  God be with
thee, Romuald!"
</p>

<p>
So speaking, Sérapion departed with slow steps, and I
saw him no more as at that time.
</p>

<p>
Time passed and I was well again.  Nay, I deemed that
the fears of Sérapion and my own terrors were too great,
till, one night, I dreamed a dream.
</p>

<p>
Scarce had I tasted the first drops of the cup of sleep
when I heard the curtains of my bed open and the rings
ring.  I raised myself suddenly on my arm and saw the
shadow of a woman standing by me.
</p>

<p>
Straightway I knew her for Clarimonde.
</p>

<p>
She held in her hand a little lamp, such as are placed
in tombs, and the light touched her slim fingers to a rosy
hue, that faded away in the milk-white of her arms.  She
was clad with naught on but the linen shroud that veiled her
when she lay in state; the folds were clasped about her
breast, as it were in pudency, by a hand all too small.  So
white she was that her shroud and her body were blended in
the pallid glow of the lamp.
</p>

<p>
Swathed thus in the fine tissue that betrayed every line
of her figure, she seemed a marble image of some lady at
the bath rather than a living woman.  Dead or living, statue
or woman, spirit or flesh, her beauty was the same; only
the glitter of her dull sea-green eyes was dulled&mdash;only the
mouth, so red of old, wore but a tender tint of rose, like the
white rose of her cheeks.  The little blue flowers that I had
seen in her hair were sere now, and all but bloomless; yet so
winning was she, so winning that, despite the strangeness of
the adventure and her inexplicable invasion of my chamber,
I was not afraid for one moment.
</p>

<p>
She placed the lamp on the table, and sat down by my
bed-foot.  Then, in those soft and silver accents which I
never heard from any lips but hers&mdash;"Long have I made thee
wait for me," she said, "and thou must have deemed that I
had forgotten thee quite.  But lo!  I come from far, very
far&mdash;even from that land whence no traveler has returned.  There
is no sunlight nor moon in the country whence I wander,
only shadow and space.  There the foot finds no rest, nor the
wandering wing any way; yet here am I; behold me, for
Love can conquer Death.  Ah, what sad faces and terrible
eyes have I seen in my voyaging, and in what labor hath
my soul been to find my body and to make her home therein
again!  How hard to lift was the stone that they had laid on
me for a covering!  Lo, my hands are sorely wounded in
that toil!  Kiss them, my love, and heal them."  And she
laid her chill palms, on my mouth, that I kissed many
times, she smiling on me with an inexpressible sweetness
of delight.
</p>

<p>
To my shame be it spoken, I had wholly forgotten the
counsels of the Abbé Sérapion, and the sacred character of
my ministry.  I fell unresisting at the first attack.  Nay, I
did not even try to bid the tempter avaunt, but succumbed
without a struggle before the sweet freshness of Clarimonde's
fair body.  Poor child! for all that is come and
gone, I can scarce believe that she was indeed a devil;
surely there was naught of the devil in her aspect.  Never
hath Satan better concealed his claws and his horns!
</p>

<p>
She was crouching on the side of my bed, her heels drawn
up beneath her in an attitude of careless and provoking
grace.  Once and again she would pass her little hands
among my locks, and curl them, as if to try what style best
suited my face.  It is worth noting that I felt no astonishment
at an adventure so marvelous&mdash;nay, as in a dream the
strangest events fail to surprise us, even so the whole
encounter seemed to me perfectly natural.
</p>

<p>
"I loved thee long before I saw thee, Romuald, my love,
and I sought for thee everywhere.  Thou wert my dream,
and I beheld thee in the church at that fatal hour.  'It is he,'
I whispered to myself, and cast on thee a glance fulfilled of
all the love wherewith I had loved, and did love, and shall
love thee; a glance that would have ruined the soul of a
cardinal or brought a king with all his court to my feet.
</p>

<p>
"But thou wert not moved, and before my love thou didst
place the love of God.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, 'tis of God that I am jealous&mdash;God whom thou hast
loved and lovest more than me.
</p>

<p>
"Miserable woman that I am!  Never shall I have all thy
heart for myself alone&mdash;for me, whom thou didst awaken
with one kiss; for me, Clarimonde, the dead; for me, who for
thy sake have broken the portals of the grave, and am come
to offer to thee a life that hath been taken up again for this
one end to make thee happy."
</p>

<p>
So she spoke; and every word was broken in on by maddening
caresses, till my brain swam, and I feared not to
console her by this awful blasphemy, namely&mdash;<i>That my love
of her passed my love of God!</i>
</p>

<p>
Then the fire of her eyes was rekindled, and they blazed
as it had been the chrysoprase stone.
</p>

<p>
"Verily thou lovest me with a love like thy love of God,"
she cried, making her fair arms a girdle for my body.  "Then
thou shalt come with me, and whithersoever I go wilt thou
follow.  Thou wilt leave thine ugly black robes, thou wilt
be of all knights the proudest and the most envied.  The
acknowledged lover of Clarimonde shalt thou be, of her who
refused a Pope!  Ah, happy life, oh, golden days that shall
be ours!  When do we mount and ride, <i>mon gentilhomme</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow," I cried in my madness.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow," she answered, "I shall have time to change
this robe of mine that is somewhat scant, nor fit for
voyaging.  Also must I speak with my retainers, that think me
dead in good earnest, and lament me, as well they may.
Money, carriages, change of raiment, all shall be ready for
thee; at this hour to-morrow will I seek thee.  Good-by,
sweetheart."
</p>

<p>
She touched my brow with her lips, the lamp faded into
darkness, the curtains closed, a sleep like lead came down on
me, sleep without a dream.
</p>

<p>
I wakened late, troubled by the memory of my dream,
which at length I made myself believe was but a vision of
the night.  Yet it was not without dread that I sought rest
again, praying Heaven to guard the purity of my slumber.
</p>

<p>
Anon I fell again into a deep sleep, and my dream began
again.  The curtains opened, and there stood Clarimonde,
not pale in her pale shroud, nor with the violets of death
upon her cheek; but gay, bright, splendid, in a traveling robe
of green velvet with trappings of gold, and kilted up on one
side to show a satin undercoat.  Her fair, curled locks fell
in great masses from under a large black beaver hat, with
strange white plumes; in her hand she held a little riding-whip,
topped with a golden whistle.  With this she touched
me gently, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Awake, fair sleeper!  Is it thus you prepare for your
voyage?  I had thought to find you alert.  Rise, quickly; we
have no time to lose!"
</p>

<p>
I leaped out of bed.
</p>

<p>
"Come, dress, and let us be gone," she said, showing me
a packet she had brought.  "Our horses are fretting and
champing at the gate.  We should be ten leagues from
here."
</p>

<p>
I arrayed myself in haste, while she instructed me, handed
me the various articles of a knight's attire, and laughed at my
clumsiness.  She dressed my hair, and when all was done,
gave me a little Venice pocket-mirror in a silver frame,
crying:
</p>

<p>
"What think you of yourself now?  Will you take me for
your valet de chambre?"
</p>

<p>
I did not know my own face in the glass, and was no more
like myself than a statue is like the uncut stone.  I was
beautiful, and I was vain of the change.  The gold embroidered
gallant attire made me another man, and I marveled at
the magic of a few ells of cloth, fashioned to certain device.
The character of my clothes became my own, and in ten
minutes I was sufficiently conceited.
</p>

<p>
Clarimonde watched me with a kind of maternal fondness
as I walked up and down the room, proving my new raiment
as it were; then:
</p>

<p>
"Come," she cried; "enough of this child's play!  Up and
away, my Romuald!  We have far to go; we shall never
arrive."
</p>

<p>
She took my hand and led me forth.  The gates opened
at her touch; the dog did not waken as we passed.
</p>

<p>
At the gate we found the groom with three horses like
those he had led before: Tennets of Spain, the children of
the wind.  Swift as the wind they sped; and the moon that
had risen to light us at our going, spun down the sky behind
us like a wheel broken loose from the axle; we seemed to
see her on our right, leaping from tree to tree as she strove
to follow our course.  Presently we came on a plain, where
a carriage with four horses waited for us; and the postilion
drove them to a mad gallop.  My arm was round the waist
of Clarimonde, her head lay on my shoulder, her breast
touched my arm.  Never had I known such delight.  All that
I had been was forgotten, like the months before birth, so
great was the power of the devil over my heart.
</p>

<p>
From that date mine became a double life; within me
were two men that knew each other not&mdash;the priest who
dreamed that by night he was a noble, the noble who
dreamed that by night he was a priest.  I could not divide
dreams from waking, nor tell where truth ended and illusion
began.  Two spirals, blended but touching not, might be
a parable of my confused existence.  Yet, strange as it was,
I believe I never was insane.  The experience of either life
dwells distinct and separate in my memory.  Only there was
this inexplicable fact&mdash;the feeling of one personality existed
in both these two different men.  Of this I have never found
an explanation, whether I was for the moment the curé of
the village of &mdash;&mdash;, or whether I was Signor Romualdo, the
avowed lover of Clarimonde.
</p>

<p>
Certain it is that I was, or believed myself to be, in
Venice&mdash;in a great palace on the Grand Canal, full of
frescoes, statues, and rich in two Titians of his best
period&mdash;a palace fit for a king.  We had each our gondola, our
liveried men, our music, our poet, for Clarimonde loved life
in the great style, and in her nature was a touch of Cleopatra.
Custom could not stale her infinite variety; to love her was
to love a score of mistresses, and you were faithless to her
with herself, so strangely she could wear the beauty of any
woman that caught your fancy.  She returned my love a
hundred-fold.  She scorned the gifts of young patricians and of
the elders of the Council of Ten.  She refused the hand of
a Foscari.  Gold enough she had, she desired only love; a
young fresh love herself had wakened&mdash;a love that found in
her its first mistress and its last.
</p>

<p>
As for me, in the midst of a life of the wildest pleasure,
I should have been happy but for the nightly horror of the
dream wherein I was a curé, fasting and mortifying myself
in penance for the sins of the day.  Custom made my life
with her familiar, and it was rarely that I remembered (and
that never with fear) the words of the Abbé Sérapion.
</p>

<p>
For some time Clarimonde had not been herself, her
health failing, her complexion growing paler day by day.
The physicians were of no avail, and she grew cold and
dead as on the wondrous night in the nameless castle.  Sadly
she smiled on my distress, with the fatal smile of those who
know that their death is near.  One morning I sat on her
bed, breakfasting at a small table hard by; as it chanced in
cutting a fruit I gashed my finger deeply; the blood came
in purple streams; and spurted up on Clarimonde.  Her eyes
brightened, her face took on a savage joy and greed such as
I had never seen.  She leaped from the bed like a cat, seized
my wounded hand, and sucked the blood with unspeakable
pleasure, slowly, gently like a connoisseur tasting some rare
wine.
</p>

<p>
In her half-closed eyes the round pupil grew long in shape.
Again and again she stopped to kiss my hand, and then
pressed her lips once more on the wound, to squeeze out the
red drops.
</p>

<p>
When she saw that the blood was stanched, she rose;
her eyes brilliant and humid, her face as rosy as a dawn of
May, her hand warm and moist; in short, more lovely than
of old, and in perfect health.
</p>

<p>
"I shall not die!  I shall not die!" she exclaimed, wild
with delight, as she embraced me.  "I shall yet love thee
long; for my life is in thine, and all that is in me comes from
thee.  Some drops of thy rich and noble blood, more precious
than all the elixirs in the world, have given me back my
life."
</p>

<p>
This event, and the strange doubts it inspired, haunted
me long.  When the night and sleep brought me back to my
priest's home, I beheld Sérapion, more anxious than ever,
more careful and troubled.  He gazed on me steadfastly, and
said:
</p>

<p>
"Not content with losing thy soul, thou art also desirous
of ruining thy body.  Unhappy young man, in what a net
hast thou fallen!"
</p>

<p>
The tone of his voice struck cold on me; but a thousand
new cares made me forget his words.  Yet, one night I
saw in a mirror that Clarimonde was pouring a powder
into the spiced wine-cup she mingled after supper.  I took
the cup, pretending to drink, but really casting the potion
away beneath the table.  Then I went to bed, intent on
watching and seeing what should come to pass.  Nor did
I wait long.  Clarimonde entered, cast off her night attire,
and lay down by my side.  When she was assured that I
slept, she uncovered my arm, drew a golden pin from her
hair, and then fell a-murmuring thus:
</p>

<p>
"One drop, one little crimson drop, one ruby on the tip
of my needle!  Since thou lovest me yet, I must not die.
Sleep, my god, my child, my all; I shall not harm thee; of
thy life I will but take what is needful for mine.  Alas! poor
love; alas! fair purple blood that I must drink!  Ah, fair
arm, so round, so white, never will I dare to prick that
pretty violet vein."
</p>

<p>
So speaking, she wept, and the tears fell hot on my arm.
At length she came to a resolve, pricked me with the needle,
and sucked the blood that flowed.  But a few drops did she
taste, for fear of exhausting me, then she anointed the tiny
wound, and fastened a little bandage about my arm.
</p>

<p>
I could no longer doubt it, Sérapion had spoken sooth.
Yet must I needs love Clarimonde, and would willingly
have given her all the blood in my veins that then were rich
enough.  Nor was I afraid, the woman in her was more than
surety for the vampire.  I could have pricked my own arm
and said, "Drink; let my love become part of thy being with
my blood."  I never spoke a word of the narcotic that she
had poured out for me, never a word of the needle; we lived
together in perfect union of hearts.
</p>

<p>
It was my scruples as a priest that disquieted me.  How
could I touch the Host with hands polluted in such
debauches, real or dreamed of?  At night I struggled against
sleep, holding mine eyelids open, standing erect against
walls; but mine eyes were filled with the sand of sleep, and
the wave carried me even where it would, down to the siren
shores.
</p>

<p>
Sérapion reproached me often.  One day he came and
said: "To drive away the devil that possesses thee there is
but one art; great ills demand harsh remedies.  I know
where Clarimonde is buried; we must unearth her, and the
sight of the worms and the dust of death will make thee
thyself again."
</p>

<p>
So weary was I of my double life, so eager to know
whether the priest or the noble was the true man, which
the dream, that I accepted his plan, being determined to
slay one or the other of the beings that dwelt within me; ay,
or to slay them both, for such a life as mine could not endure.
</p>

<p>
The Abbé Sérapion took a lantern, a pick, a crowbar, and
at midnight we set out for the graveyard.  After throwing
the light of the lantern on several tombs, we reached a stone
half-hidden by tall weeds, and covered with ivy, moss, and
lichen.  Thereon we read these words graven:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  ICI GIT CLARIMONDE<br>
  QUI PUT DE SON VIVANTE<br>
  LA PLUS BELLE DU MONDE<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"'Tis here!" said Sérapion, who, laying down his lantern,
thrust the crowbar in a cleft of the stone, and began to raise
it.  Slowly it gave place, and he set to work with the
pick-ax.  For me, I watched him dark and silent as the night,
while his face, when he raised it, ran with sweat, and his
laboring breath came like the death-rattle in his throat.
Methought the deed was a sacrilege, and I would fain have
seen the lightning leap from the cloud, and strike Sérapion
to ashes.
</p>

<p>
The owls of the graveyard, attracted by the light, flocked
and flapped about the lantern with their wings; their hooting
sounded wofully; the foxes barked their answer far away;
a thousand evil sounds broke from the stillness.
</p>

<p>
At length the pick of Sérapion smote the coffin-lid; the
four planks answered sullenly, as the void of nothingness
replied to the touch.  Sérapion raised the coffin-lid, and
there I saw Clarimonde, pale as marble, her hands joined,
the long white shroud flowing unbroken to her feet.
</p>

<p>
On her pale mouth shone one rosy drop, and Sérapion,
breaking forth in fury, cried:
</p>

<p>
"Ah, there thou liest, devil, harlot, vampire, thou that
drainest the blood of men!"
</p>

<p>
With this he sprinkled holy water over my lady, whose
fair body straightway crumbled into earth, a dreadful
mingling of dust and the ashes of bones half-burned.
</p>

<p>
"There lies thy leman, Sir Romuald," he said; "go now
and dally at the Lido with thy beauty."
</p>

<p>
I bowed my head; within me all was ruin.  Back to my
poor priest's house I went; and Romuald, the lover of
Clarimonde, said farewell to the priest, with whom so long and
so strangely he had companioned.
</p>

<p>
But, next night, I saw Clarimonde.
</p>

<p>
"Wretched man that thou art," she cried, as of old under
the church porch, "what hast thou done?  Why hast thou
hearkened to that foolish priest?  Wert thou not happy, or
what ill had I done thee that thou must violate my tomb,
and lay bare the wretchedness of the grave?  Henceforth is
the link between our souls and bodies broken.  Farewell!
Thou shalt desire me."
</p>

<p>
Then she fled away into air, like smoke, and I saw her
no more.
</p>

<p>
Alas! it was truth she spoke; more than once have I
sorrowed for her&mdash;nay, I long for her still.  Dearly purchased
hath my salvation been, and the love of God hath not been
too much to replace the love of her.
</p>

<p>
Behold, brother, all the story of my youth.
</p>

<p>
Let not thine eyes look ever upon a woman; walk always
with glance downcast; for, be ye chaste and be ye cold as
ye may, one minute may damn you to all eternity.
</p>

THE RED ROOM
</h3>

<p class="t3">
BY H. G. WELLS
</p>

<p class="intro">
<i>Herbert George Wells (born 1866), on his
graduation in 1888 from the Royal College
of Science, took up the serious side of science
as a career, publishing in 1892-93 a
textbook on biology.  An editorial connection
(with "The Saturday Review" in 1894-96)
turned his attention to the literary possibilities
of his favorite study, and in 1895 he
began a series of novels in which by an
extraordinary prescience of imagination he
developed the suggestions of modern science
into marvelous embodiments of newly
discovered principles and powers which are
shown to result in profound changes in both
the social and individual character of man.</i>

THE RED ROOM
</p>

<p class="t3">
By H. G. WELLS
</p>

<p>
"I can assure you," said I, "that it will take a very
tangible ghost to frighten me."  And I stood up
before the fire with my glass in my hand.
</p>

<p>
"It is your own choosing," said the man with
the withered arm, and glanced at me askance.
</p>

<p>
"Eight-and-twenty years," said I, "I have lived, and never
a ghost have I seen as yet."
</p>

<p>
The old woman sat staring hard into the fire, her pale
eyes wide open.  "Ay," she broke in, "and eight-and-twenty
years you have lived, and never seen the likes of this house,
I reckon.  There's a many things to see, when one's still
but eight-and-twenty."  She swayed her head slowly from
side to side.  "A many things to see and sorrow for."
</p>

<p>
I half suspected these old people were trying to enhance
the spectral terrors of their house by this droning insistence.
I put down my empty glass on the table, and, looking about
the room, caught a glimpse of myself, abbreviated and
broadened to an impossible sturdiness, in the queer old mirror
beside the china cupboard.  "Well," I said, "if I see anything
to-night, I shall be so much the wiser.  For I come to the
business with an open mind."
</p>

<p>
"It's your own choosing," said the man with the withered
arm once more.
</p>

<p>
I heard the faint sound of a stick and a shambling step
on the flags in the passage outside.  The door creaked on its
hinges as a second old man entered, more bent, more wrinkled,
more aged even than the first.  He supported himself
by the help of a crutch, his eyes were covered by a shade,
and his lower lip, half averted, hung pale and pink from his
decaying yellow teeth.  He made straight for an armchair on
the opposite side of the table, sat down clumsily, and began
to cough.  The man with the withered hand gave the
new-comer a short glance of positive dislike; the old woman took
no notice of his arrival, but remained with her eyes fixed
steadily on the fire.
</p>

<p>
"I said&mdash;it's your own choosing," said the man with the
withered hand, when the coughing had ceased for a while.
</p>

<p>
"It's my own choosing," I answered.
</p>

<p>
The man with the shade became aware of my presence for
the first time, and threw his head back for a moment, and
sidewise, to see me.  I caught a momentary glimpse of his
eyes, small and bright and inflamed.  Then he began to
cough and splutter again.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you drink?" said the man with the withered
arm, pushing the beer toward him.  The man with the shade
poured out a glassful with a shaking hand, that splashed half
as much again on the deal table.  A monstrous shadow of
him crouched upon the wall, and mocked his action as he
poured and drank.  I must confess I had scarcely expected
these grotesque custodians.  There is, to my mind, something
inhuman in senility, something crouching and atavistic;
the human qualities seem to drop from old people insensibly
day by day.  The three of them made me feel uncomfortable
with their gaunt silences, their bent carriage, their
evident unfriendliness to me and to one another.  And that
night, perhaps, I was in the mood for uncomfortable
impressions.  I resolved to get away from their vague
foreshadowings of the evil things upstairs.
</p>

<p>
"If," said I, "you will show me to this haunted room of
yours, I will make myself comfortable there."
</p>

<p>
The old man with the cough jerked his head back so
suddenly that it startled me, and shot another glance of
his red eyes at me from out of the darkness under the shade,
but no one answered me.  I waited a minute, glancing from
one to the other.  The old woman stared like a dead body,
glaring into the fire with lack-lustre eyes.
</p>

<p>
"If," I said, a little louder, "if you will show me to this
haunted room of yours, I will relieve you from the task of
entertaining me."
</p>

<p>
"There's a candle on the slab outside the door," said the
man with the withered hand, looking at my feet as he
addressed me.  "But if you go to the Red Room to-night&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"This night of all nights!" said the old woman, softly.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;You go alone."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," I answered, shortly, "and which way do I go?"
</p>

<p>
"You go along the passage for a bit," said he, nodding his
head on his shoulder at the door, "until you come to a spiral
staircase; and on the second landing is a door covered with
green baize.  Go through that, and down the long corridor
to the end, and the Red Room is on your left up the steps."
</p>

<p>
"Have I got that right?" I said, and repeated his directions.
</p>

<p>
He corrected me in one particular.
</p>

<p>
"And you are really going?" said the man with the shade,
looking at me again for the third time with that queer,
unnatural tilting of the face.
</p>

<p>
"This night of all nights!" whispered the old woman.
</p>

<p>
"It is what I came for," I said, and moved toward the
door.  As I did so, the old man with the shade rose and
staggered round the table, so as to be closer to the others
and to the fire.  At the door I turned and looked at them,
and saw they were all close together, dark against the
firelight, staring at me over their shoulders, with an intent
expression on their ancient faces.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night," I said, setting the door open.
</p>

<p>
"It's your own choosing," said the man with the
withered arm.
</p>

<p>
I left the door wide open until the candle was well alight,
and then I shut them in, and walked down the chilly,
echoing passage.
</p>

<p>
I must confess that the oddness of these three old pensioners
in whose charge her ladyship had left the castle, and
the deep-toned, old-fashioned furniture of the housekeeper's
room, in which they foregathered, had affected me curiously
in spite of my effort to keep myself at a matter-of-fact phase.
They seemed to belong to another age, an older age, an age
when things spiritual were indeed to be feared, when
common sense was uncommon, an age when omens and witches
were credible, and ghosts beyond denying.  Their very
existence, thought I, is spectral; the cut of their clothing,
fashions born in dead brains; the ornaments and conveniences
in the room about them even are ghostly&mdash;the
thoughts of vanished men, which still haunt rather than
participate in the world of to-day.  And the passage I was in,
long and shadowy, with a film of moisture glistening on the
wall, was as gaunt and cold as a thing that is dead and rigid.
But with an effort I sent such thoughts to the right-about.
The long, drafty subterranean passage was chilly and dusty,
and my candle flared and made the shadows cower and
quiver.  The echoes rang up and down the spiral staircase,
and a shadow came sweeping up after me, and another fled
before me into the darkness overhead.  I came to the wide
landing and stopped there for a moment listening to a
rustling that I fancied I heard creeping behind me, and
then, satisfied of the absolute silence, pushed open the
unwilling baize-covered door and stood in the silent corridor.
</p>

<p>
The effect was scarcely what I expected, for the moonlight,
coming in by the great window on the grand staircase,
picked out everything in vivid black shadow or reticulated
silvery illumination.  Everything seemed in its proper
position; the house might have been deserted on the yesterday
instead of twelve months ago.  There were candles in the
sockets of the sconces, and whatever dust had gathered on
the carpets or upon the polished flooring was distributed so
evenly as to be invisible in my candlelight.  A waiting
stillness was over everything.  I was about to advance, and
stopped abruptly.  A bronze group stood upon the landing
hidden from me by a corner of the wall; but its shadow fell
with marvelous distinctness upon the white paneling, and
gave me the impression of some one crouching to waylay
me.  The thing jumped upon my attention suddenly.  I stood
rigid for half a moment, perhaps.  Then, with my hand in
the pocket that held the revolver, I advanced, only to
discover a Ganymede and Eagle, glistening in the moonlight.
That incident for a time restored my nerve, and a dim
porcelain Chinaman on a buhl table, whose head rocked as I
passed, scarcely startled me.
</p>

<p>
The door of the Red Room and the steps up to it were
in a shadowy corner.  I moved my candle from side to side
in order to see clearly the nature of the recess in which I
stood, before opening the door.  Here it was, thought I, that
my predecessor was found, and the memory of that story
gave me a sudden twinge of apprehension.  I glanced over
my shoulder at the black Ganymede in the moonlight, and
opened the door of the Red Room rather hastily, with my
face half turned to the pallid silence of the corridor.
</p>

<p>
I entered, closed the door behind me at once, turned the
key I found in the lock within, and stood with the candle
held aloft surveying the scene of my vigil, the great Red
Room of Lorraine Castle, in which the young Duke had
died; or rather in which he had begun his dying, for he had
opened the door and fallen headlong down the steps I had
just ascended.  That had been the end of his vigil, of his
gallant attempt to conquer the ghostly tradition of the place,
and never, I thought, had apoplexy better served the ends of
superstition.  There were other and older stories that clung
to the room, back to the half-incredible beginning of it all,
the tale of a timid wife and the tragic end that came to her
husband's jest of frightening her.  And looking round that
huge shadowy room with its black window bays, its recesses
and alcoves, its dusty brown-red hangings and dark gigantic
furniture, one could well understand the legends that had
sprouted in its black corners, its germinating darknesses.
My candle was a little tongue of light in the vastness of the
chamber; its rays failed to pierce to the opposite end of the
room, and left an ocean of dull red mystery and suggestion,
sentinel shadows and watching darknesses beyond its island
of light.  And the stillness of desolation brooded over it all.
</p>

<p>
I must confess some impalpable quality of that ancient
room disturbed me.  I tried to fight the feeling down.  I
resolved to make a systematic examination of the place, and
so, by leaving nothing to the imagination, dispel the fanciful
suggestions of the obscurity before they obtained a hold
upon me.  After satisfying myself of the fastening of the
door, I began to walk round the room, peering round each
article of furniture, tucking up the valances of the bed and
opening its curtains wide.  In one place there was a distinct
echo to my footsteps, the noises I made seemed so little
that they enhanced rather than broke the silence of the
place.  I pulled up the blinds and examined the fastenings
of the several windows.  Attracted by the fall of a particle
of dust, I leaned forward and looked up the blackness of
the wide chimney.  Then, trying to preserve my scientific
attitude of mind, I walked round and began tapping the oak
paneling for any secret opening, but I desisted before
reaching the alcove.  I saw my face in a mirror&mdash;white.
</p>

<p>
There were two big mirrors in the room, each with a
pair of sconces bearing candles, and on the mantelshelf, too,
were candles in china candlesticks.  All these I lit one after
the other.  The fire was laid&mdash;an unexpected consideration
from the old housekeeper&mdash;and I lit it, to keep down any
disposition to shiver, and when it was burning well I stood
round with my back to it and regarded the room again.  I
had pulled up a chintz-covered armchair and a table to form
a kind of barricade before me.  On this lay my revolver,
ready to hand.  My precise examination had done me a little
good, but I still found the remoter darkness of the place and
its perfect stillness too stimulating for the imagination.  The
echoing of the stir and crackling of the fire was no sort of
comfort to me.  The shadow in the alcove at the end of
the room began to display that undefinable quality of a
presence, that odd suggestion of a lurking living thing that
comes so easily in silence and solitude.  And to reassure
myself, I walked with a candle into it and satisfied myself
that there was nothing tangible there.  I stood that candle
upon the floor of the alcove and left it in that position.
</p>

<p>
By this time I was in a state of considerable nervous
tension, although to my reason there was no adequate cause
for my condition.  My mind, however, was perfectly clear.
I postulated quite unreservedly that nothing supernatural
could happen, and to pass the time I began stringing some
rhymes together, Ingoldsby fashion, concerning the original
legend of the place.  A few I spoke aloud, but the echoes
were not pleasant.  For the same reason I also abandoned,
after a time, a conversation with myself upon the
impossibility of ghosts and haunting.  My mind reverted to the three
old and distorted people downstairs, and I tried to keep it
upon that topic.
</p>

<p>
The sombre reds and grays of the room troubled me;
even with its seven candles the place was merely dim.  The
light in the alcove flaring in a draft, and the fire flickering,
kept the shadows and penumbra perpetually shifting and
stirring in a noiseless flighty dance.  Casting about for a
remedy, I recalled the wax candles I had seen in the corridor,
and, with a slight effort, carrying a candle and leaving
the door open, I walked out into the moonlight, and presently
returned with as many as ten.  These I put in the various
knick-knacks of china with which the room was sparsely
adorned, and lit and placed them where the shadows had
lain deepest, some on the floor, some in the window recesses,
arranging and rearranging them until at last my seventeen
candles were so placed that not an inch of the room but had
the direct light of at least one of them.  It occurred to me
that when the ghost came I could warn him not to trip over
them.  The room was now quite brightly illuminated.  There
was something very cheering and reassuring in these little
silent streaming flames, and to notice their steady diminution
of length offered me an occupation and gave me a reassuring
sense of the passage of time.
</p>

<p>
Even with that, however, the brooding expectation of the
vigil weighed heavily enough upon me.  I stood watching the
minute hand of my watch creep towards midnight.
</p>

<p>
Then something happened in the alcove.  I did not see the
candle go out, I simply turned and saw that the darkness was
there, as one might start and see the unexpected presence of
a stranger.  The black shadow had sprung back to its place.
"By Jove," said I aloud, recovering from my surprise, "that
draft's a strong one;" and taking the matchbox from the
table, I walked across the room in a leisurely manner to
relight the corner again.  My first match would not strike, and
as I succeeded with the second, something seemed to blink
on the wall before me.  I turned my head involuntarily and
saw that the two candles on the little table by the fireplace
were extinguished.  I rose at once to my feet.
</p>

<p>
"Odd," I said.  "Did I do that myself in a flash of
absent-mindedness?"
</p>

<p>
I walked back, relit one, and as I did so I saw the candle
in the right sconce of one of the mirrors wink and go right
out, and almost immediately its companion followed it.  The
flames vanished as if the wick had been suddenly nipped
between a finger and thumb, leaving the wick neither glowing
nor smoking, but black.  While I stood gaping the candle at
the foot of the bed went out, and the shadows seemed to
take another step toward me.
</p>

<p>
"This won't do!" said I, and first one and then another
candle on the mantelshelf followed.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?" I cried, with a queer high note getting into
my voice somehow.  At that the candle on the corner of the
wardrobe went out, and the one I had relit in the alcove
followed.
</p>

<p>
"Steady on!" I said, "those candles are wanted," speaking
with a half-hysterical facetiousness, and scratching away at
a match the while, "for the mantel candlesticks."  My hands
trembled so much that twice I missed the rough paper of the
matchbox.  As the mantel emerged from darkness again, two
candles in the remoter end of the room were eclipsed.  But
with the same match I also relit the larger mirror candles,
and those on the floor near the doorway, so that for the
moment I seemed to gain on the extinctions.  But then in a
noiseless volley there vanished four lights at once in
different corners of the room, and I struck another match
in quivering haste, and stood hesitating whither to take it.
</p>

<p>
As I stood undecided, an invisible hand seemed to sweep
out the two candles on the table.  With a cry of terror I
dashed at the alcove, then into the corner and then into the
window, relighting three as two more vanished by the
fireplace, and then, perceiving a better way, I dropped matches
on the iron-bound deedbox in the corner, and caught up the
bedroom candlestick.  With this I avoided the delay of striking
matches, but for all that the steady process of extinction
went on, and the shadows I feared and fought against returned,
and crept in upon me, first a step gained on this side
of me, then on that.  I was now almost frantic with the horror
of the coming darkness, and my self-possession deserted me.
I leaped panting from candle to candle in a vain struggle
against that remorseless advance.
</p>

<p>
I bruised myself in the thigh against the table, I sent a
chair headlong, I stumbled and fell and whisked the cloth
from the table in my fall.  My candle rolled away from me
and I snatched another as I rose.  Abruptly this was blown
out as I swung it off the table by the wind of my sudden
movement, and immediately the two remaining candles followed.
But there was light still in the room, a red light, that
streamed across the ceiling and staved off the shadows from
me.  The fire!  Of course I could still thrust my candle
between the bars and relight it!
</p>

<p>
I turned to where the flames were still dancing between
the glowing coals and splashing red reflections upon the
furniture; made two steps toward the grate, and incontinently the
flames dwindled and vanished, the glow vanished, the
reflections rushed together and disappeared, and as I thrust the
candle between the bars darkness closed upon me like the
shutting of an eye, wrapped about me in a stifling embrace,
sealed my vision, and crushed the last vestiges of self-possession
from my brain.  And it was not only palpable darkness,
but intolerable terror.  The candle fell from my hands.
I flung out my arms in a vain effort to thrust that ponderous
blackness away from me, and lifting up my voice, screamed
with all my might, once, twice, thrice.  Then I think I must
have staggered to my feet.  I know I thought suddenly of the
moonlit corridor, and with my head bowed and my arms
over my face, made a stumbling run for the door.
</p>

<p>
But I had forgotten the exact position of the door, and I
struck myself heavily against the corner of the bed.  I
staggered back, turned, and was either struck or struck myself
against some other bulky furnishing.  I have a vague memory
of battering myself thus to and fro in the darkness, of a
heavy blow at last upon my forehead, of a horrible sensation
of falling that lasted an age, of my last frantic effort
to keep my footing, and then I remember no more.
</p>

<p>
I opened my eyes in daylight.  My head was roughly
bandaged, and the man with the withered hand was watching
my face.  I looked about me trying to remember what had
happened, and for a space I could not recollect.  I rolled
my eyes into the corner and saw the old woman, no longer
abstracted, no longer terrible, pouring out some drops of
medicine from a little blue phial into a glass.  "Where am
I?" I said.  "I seem to remember you, and yet I can not
remember who you are."
</p>

<p>
They told me then, and I heard of the haunted Red Room
as one who hears a tale.  "We found you at dawn," said he,
"and there was blood on your forehead and lips."
</p>

<p>
I wondered that I had ever disliked him.  The three of
them in the daylight seemed commonplace old folk enough.
The man with the green shade had his head bent as one who
sleeps.
</p>

<p>
It was very slowly I recovered the memory of my
experience.  "You believe now," said the old man with the
withered hand, "that the room is haunted?"  He spoke no
longer as one who greets an intruder, but as one who
condoles with a friend.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I, "the room is haunted."
</p>

<p>
"And you have seen it.  And we who have been here
all our lives have never set eyes upon it.  Because we have
never dared.  Tell us, is it truly the old earl who&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No," said I, "it is not."
</p>

<p>
"I told you so," said the old lady, with the glass in her
hand.  "It is his poor young countess who was frightened&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It is not," I said.  "There is neither ghost of earl nor
ghost of countess in that room; there is no ghost there at
all, but worse, far worse, something impalpable&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well?" they said.
</p>

<p>
"The worst of all the things that haunt poor mortal
men," said I; "and that is, in all its nakedness&mdash;'Fear!'  Fear
that will not have light nor sound, that will not bear with
reason, that deafens and darkens and overwhelms.  It followed
me through the corridor, it fought against me in the
room&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I stopped abruptly.  There was an interval of silence.
My hand went up to my bandages.  "The candles went out
one after another, and I fled&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Then the man with the shade lifted his face sideways to
see me and spoke.
</p>

<p>
"That is it," said he.  "I knew that was it.  A Power of
Darkness.  To put such a curse upon a home!  It lurks there
always.  You can feel it even in the daytime, even of a
bright summer's day, in the hangings, in the curtains,
keeping behind you however you face about.  In the dusk it
creeps in the corridor and follows you, so that you dare not
turn.  It is even as you say.  Fear itself is in that room.
Black Fear...  And there it will be ... so long as this
house of sin endures."

THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW
</h3>

<p class="t3">
BY RUDYARD KIPLING
</p>

<p class="intro">
<i>Joseph Rudyard Kipling was born in Bombay
in 1865.  The grandson of a clergyman,
both on his father's and mother's side, he
was educated in England and served his
apprenticeship as a writer on the newspapers
in India.  No man ever tried harder to convey
to his reader the sensation and very pulse of
life that he himself felt than did Kipling in
his early work, of which "The Phantom
'Rickshaw" is a well-known example.  Though he
is undoubtedly one of the great writers of
short stories, we are still too near him to be
able to clearly appreciate his great talents.</i>

THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW
</p>

<p class="t3">
By RUDYARD KIPLING
</p>

<p>
My doctor tells me that I need rest and change of
air.  It is not improbable that I shall get both ere
long&mdash;rest that neither the red-coated messenger
nor the midday gun can break, and change of air
far beyond that which any homeward-bound steamer can
give me.  In the meantime, I am resolved to stay where I
am; and, in flat defiance of my doctor's orders, to take all the
world into my confidence.  You shall learn for yourselves
the precise nature of my malady; and shall, too, judge for
yourselves whether any man born of woman on this weary
earth was ever so tormented as I.
</p>

<p>
Speaking now as a condemned criminal might speak ere
the drop-bolts are drawn, my story, wild and hideously
improbable as it may appear, demands at least attention.  That
it will ever receive credence I utterly disbelieve.  Two months
ago I should have scouted as mad or drunk the man who
had dared tell me the like.  Two months ago I was the
happiest man in India.  To-day, from Peshawur to the sea, there
is no one more wretched.  My doctor and I are the only
two who know this.  His explanation is, that my brain,
digestion, and eyesight are all slightly affected; giving rise to
my frequent and persistent "delusions."  Delusions, indeed!
I call him a fool; but he attends me still with the same
unwearied smile, the same bland professional manner, the same
neatly trimmed red whiskers, till I begin to suspect that I
am an ungrateful, evil-tempered invalid.  But you shall judge
for yourselves.
</p>

<p>
Three years ago it was my fortune&mdash;my great misfortune&mdash;to
sail from Gravesend to Bombay, on return from long
leave, with one Agnes Keith-Wessington, wife of an officer
on the Bombay side.  It does not in the least concern you to
know what manner of woman she was.  Be content with the
knowledge that, ere the voyage had ended, both she and I
were desperately and unreasonably in love with each other.
Heaven knows that I can make the admission now without
one particle of vanity.  In matters of this sort there is
always one who gives and another who accepts.  From the
first day of our ill-omened attachment, I was conscious that
Agnes's passion was a stronger, a more dominant, and&mdash;if I
may use the expression&mdash;a purer sentiment than mine.
Whether she recognized the fact then, I do not know.
Afterward it was bitterly plain to both of us.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at Bombay in the spring of the year, we went
our respective ways, to meet no more for the next three or
four months, when my leave and her love took us both to
Simla.  There we spent the season together; and there my
fire of straw burned itself out to a pitiful end with the closing
year.  I attempt no excuse.  I make no apology.  Mrs. Wessington
had given up much for my sake, and was prepared
to give up all.  From my own lips, in August, 1882,
she learned that I was sick of her presence, tired of her
company, and weary of the sound of her voice.  Ninety-nine
women out of a hundred would have wearied of me as I
wearied of them; seventy-five of that number would have
promptly avenged themselves by active and obtrusive flirtation
with other men.  Mrs. Wessington was the hundredth.
On her neither my openly expressed aversion nor the cutting
brutalities with which I garnished our interviews had the
least effect.
</p>

<p>
"Jack, darling!" was her one eternal cuckoo cry, "I'm
sure it's all a mistake&mdash;a hideous mistake; and we'll be
good friends again some day.  <i>Please</i> forgive me, Jack
dear."
</p>

<p>
I was the offender, and I knew it.  That knowledge transformed
my pity into passive endurance, and, eventually, into
blind hate&mdash;the same instinct, I suppose, which prompts a
man to savagely stamp on the spider he has but half killed.
And with this hate in my bosom the season of 1882 came to
an end.
</p>

<p>
Next year we met again at Simla&mdash;she with her monotonous
face and timid attempts at reconciliation, and I with
loathing of her in every fibre of my frame.  Several times I
could not avoid meeting her alone; and on each occasion her
words were identically the same.  Still the unreasoning wail
that it was all a "mistake"; and still the hope of eventually
"making friends."  I might have seen, had I cared to look,
that that hope only was keeping her alive.  She grew more
wan and thin month by month.  You will agree with me, at
least, that such conduct would have driven any one to
despair.  It was uncalled for; childish; unwomanly.  I
maintain that she was much to blame.  And again, sometimes, in
the black, fever-stricken night-watches, I have begun to
think that I might have been a little kinder to her.  But that
really is a "delusion."  I could not have continued pretending
to love her when I didn't; could I?  It would have been
unfair to us both.
</p>

<p>
Last year we met again&mdash;on the same terms as before.
The same weary appeals, and the same curt answers from
my lips.  At least I would make her see how wholly wrong
and hopeless were her attempts at resuming the old relationship.
As the season wore on, we fell apart&mdash;that is to say,
she found it difficult to meet me, for I had other and more
absorbing interests to attend to.  When I think it over
quietly in my sick-room, the season of 1884 seems a confused
nightmare wherein light and shade were fantastically
intermingled&mdash;my courtship of little Kitty Mannering; my
hopes, doubts, and fears; our long rides together; my
trembling avowal of attachment; her reply; and now and again
a vision of a white face flitting by in the 'rickshaw with the
black and white liveries I once watched for so earnestly; the
wave of Mrs. Wessington's gloved hand; and, when she met
me alone, which was but seldom, the irksome monotony of
her appeal.  I loved Kitty Mannering; honestly, heartily
loved her, and with my love for her grew my hatred for
Agnes.  In August, Kitty and I were engaged.  The next
day I met those accursed "magpie" jhampanies at the back
of Jakko, and, moved by some passing sentiment of pity,
stopped to tell Mrs. Wessington everything.  She knew it
already.
</p>

<p>
"So I hear you're engaged, Jack dear."  Then, without
a moment's pause&mdash;"I'm sure it's all a mistake&mdash;a hideous
mistake.  We shall be as good friends some day, Jack, as
we ever were."
</p>

<p>
My answer might have made even a man wince.  It cut
the dying woman before me like the blow of a whip.  "Please
forgive me, Jack; I didn't mean to make you angry; but it's
true, it's true!"
</p>

<p>
And Mrs. Wessington broke down completely.  I turned
away and left her to finish her journey in peace, feeling, but
only for a moment or two, that I had been an unutterably
mean hound.  I looked back, and saw that she had turned
her 'rickshaw with the idea, I suppose, of overtaking me.
</p>

<p>
The scene and its surroundings were photographed on my
memory.  The rain-swept sky (we were at the end of the
wet weather), the sodden, dingy pines, the muddy road, and
the black powder-riven cliffs formed a gloomy background
against which the black and white liveries of the jhampanies,
the yellow-paneled 'rickshaw and Mrs. Wessington's down-bowed
golden head stood out clearly.  She was holding her
handkerchief in her left hand and was leaning back exhausted
against the 'rickshaw cushions.  I turned my horse up a
by-path near the Sanjoylie Reservoir and literally ran away.
Once I fancied I heard a faint call of "Jack!"  This may
have been imagination.  I never stopped to verify it.  Ten
minutes later I came across Kitty on horseback; and, in
the delight of a long ride with her, forgot all about the
interview.
</p>

<p>
A week later Mrs. Wessington died, and the inexpressible
burden of her existence was removed from my life.  I went
plainsward perfectly happy.  Before three months were over
I had forgotten all about her, except that at times the
discovery of some of her old letters reminded me unpleasantly
of our bygone relationship.  By January I had disinterred
what was left of our correspondence from among my scattered
belongings and had burned it.  At the beginning of
April of this year, 1885, I was at Simla&mdash;semi-deserted
Simla&mdash;once more, and was deep in lover's talks and walks with
Kitty.  It was decided that we should be married at the end
of June.  You will understand, therefore, that, loving Kitty
as I did, I am not saying too much when I pronounce myself
to have been, at that time, the happiest man in India.
</p>

<p>
Fourteen delightful days passed almost before I noticed
their flight.  Then, aroused to the sense of what was proper
among mortals circumstanced as we were, I pointed out to
Kitty that an engagement-ring was the outward and visible
sign of her dignity as an engaged girl; and that she must
forthwith come to Hamilton's to be measured for one.  Up
to that moment, I give you my word, we had completely
forgotten so trivial a matter.  To Hamilton's we accordingly
went on the 15th of April, 1885.  Remember that&mdash;whatever
my doctor may say to the contrary&mdash;I was then in perfect
health, enjoying a well-balanced mind and an absolutely
tranquil spirit.  Kitty and I entered Hamilton's shop together,
and there, regardless of the order of affairs, I measured
Kitty for the ring in the presence of the amused assistant.
The ring was a sapphire with two diamonds.  We then rode
out down the slope that leads to the Combermere Bridge
and Peliti's shop.
</p>

<p>
While my waler was cautiously feeling his way over the
loose shale, and Kitty was laughing and chattering at my
side&mdash;while all Simla, that is to say as much of it as had
then come from the plains, was grouped round the reading-room
and Peliti's veranda&mdash;I was aware that some one,
apparently at a vast distance, was calling me by my Christian
name.  It struck me that I had heard the voice before,
but when and where I could not at once determine.  In the
short space it took to cover the road between the path from
Hamilton's shop and the first plank of the Combermere
Bridge I had thought over half a dozen people who might
have committed such a solecism, and had eventually decided
that it must have been some singing in my ears.  Immediately
opposite Peliti's shop my eye was arrested by the sight
of four jhampanies in "magpie" livery, pulling a
yellow-paneled, cheap, bazaar 'rickshaw.  In a moment my mind
flew back to the previous season and Mrs. Wessington with
a sense of irritation and disgust.  Was it not enough that
the woman was dead and done with, without her black and
white servitors reappearing to spoil the day's happiness?
Whoever employed them now I thought I would call upon,
and ask as a personal favor to change her jhampanies'
livery.  I would hire the men myself, and, if necessary, buy
their coats from off their backs.  It is impossible to say here
what a flood of undesirable memories their presence evoked.
</p>

<p>
"Kitty," I cried, "there are poor Mrs. Wessington's
jhampanies turned up again!  I wonder who has them now?"
</p>

<p>
Kitty had known Mrs. Wessington slightly last season,
and had always been interested in the sickly woman.
</p>

<p>
"What?  Where?" she asked.  "I can't see them anywhere."
</p>

<p>
Even as she spoke, her horse, swerving from a laden
mule, threw himself directly in front of the advancing
'rickshaw.  I had scarcely time to utter a word of warning when,
to my unutterable horror, horse and rider passed through
men and carriage as if they had been thin air.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" cried Kitty; "what made you call
out so foolishly, Jack?  If I am engaged I don't want all
creation to know about it.  There was lots of space between
the mule and the veranda; and, if you think I can't
ride&mdash;There!"
</p>

<p>
Whereupon wilful Kitty set off, her dainty little head in
the air, at a hand-gallop in the direction of the band-stand;
fully expecting, as she herself afterward told me, that I
should follow her.  What was the matter?  Nothing indeed.
Either that I was mad or drunk, or that Simla was haunted
with devils.  I reined in my impatient cob, and turned round.
The 'rickshaw had turned too, and now stood immediately
facing me, near the left railing of the Combermere Bridge.
</p>

<p>
"Jack!  Jack, darling!" (There was no mistake about
the words this time; they rang through my brain as if they
had been shouted in my ear.) "It's some hideous mistake,
I'm sure.  Please forgive me, Jack, and let's be friends
again."
</p>

<p>
The 'rickshaw-hood had fallen back, and inside, as I hope
and pray daily for the death I dread by night, sat
Mrs. Keith-Wessington, handkerchief in hand, and golden head bowed
on her breast.
</p>

<p>
How long I stared motionless I do not know.  Finally, I
was aroused by my syce taking the waler's bridle and asking
whether I was ill.  From the horrible to the commonplace is
but a step.  I tumbled off my horse and dashed, half fainting,
into Peliti's for a glass of cherry brandy.  There two or
three couples were gathered round the coffee-tables discussing
the gossip of the day.  Their trivialities were more
comforting to me just then than the consolations of religion
could have been.  I plunged into the midst of the conversation
at once; chatted, laughed, and jested with a face (when
I caught a glimpse of it in a mirror) as white and drawn as
that of a corpse.  Three or four men noticed my condition;
and, evidently setting it down to the results of overmany
pegs, charitably endeavored to draw me apart from the rest
of the loungers.  But I refused to be led away.  I wanted the
company of my kind&mdash;as a child rushes into the midst of the
dinner party after a fright in the dark.  I must have talked
for about ten minutes or so, though it seemed an eternity to
me, when I heard Kitty's clear voice outside inquiring for
me.  In another minute she had entered the shop, prepared
to roundly upbraid me for failing so signally in my duties.
Something in my face stopped her.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Jack," she cried, "what have you been doing?
What has happened?  Are you ill?"  Thus driven into a
direct lie, I said that the sun had been a little too much for
me.  It was close upon five o'clock of a cloudy April
afternoon, and the sun had been hidden all day.  I saw my
mistake as soon as the words were out of my mouth; attempted
to recover it; blundered hopelessly and followed Kitty, in a
regal rage, out-of-doors, amid the smiles of my acquaintances.
I made some excuse (I have forgotten what) on the
score of my feeling faint; and cantered away to my hotel,
leaving Kitty to finish the ride by herself.
</p>

<p>
In my room I sat down and tried calmly to reason out the
matter.  Here was I, Theobald Jack Pansay, a well-educated
Bengal civilian in the year of grace 1885, presumably sane,
certainly healthy, driven in terror from my sweetheart's side
by the apparition of a woman who had been dead and buried
eight months ago.  These were facts that I could not blink.
Nothing was further from my thought than any memory of
Mrs. Wessington when Kitty and I left Hamilton's shop.
Nothing was more utterly commonplace than the stretch of
wall opposite Peliti's.  It was broad daylight.  The road
was full of people; and yet here, look you, in defiance of
every law of probability, in direct outrage of Nature's
ordinance, there had appeared to me a face from the grave.
</p>

<p>
Kitty's Arab had gone through the 'rickshaw; so that
my first hope that some woman marvelously like Mrs. Wessington
had hired the carriage and the coolies with their old
livery was lost.  Again and again I went round this treadmill
of thought; and again and again gave up, baffled and in
despair.  The voice was as inexplicable as the apparition.
I had originally some wild notion of confiding it all to Kitty;
of begging her to marry me at once; and in her arms defying
the ghostly occupant of the 'rickshaw.  "After all," I
argued, "the presence of the 'rickshaw is in itself enough to
prove the existence of a spectral illusion.  One may see
ghosts of men and women, but surely never of coolies and
carriages.  The whole thing is absurd.  Fancy the ghost of
a hill-man!"
</p>

<p>
Next morning I sent a penitent note to Kitty, imploring
her to overlook my strange conduct of the previous
afternoon.  My divinity was still very wroth, and a personal
apology was necessary.  I explained, with a fluency born of
night-long pondering over a falsehood, that I had been
attacked with a sudden palpitation of the heart&mdash;the result of
indigestion.  This eminently practical solution had its effect;
and Kitty and I rode out that afternoon with the shadow of
my first lie dividing us.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could please her save a canter round Jakko.
With my nerves still unstrung from the previous night, I
feebly protested against the notion, suggesting Observatory
Hill, Jutogh, the Boileaugunge road&mdash;anything rather than
the Jakko round.  Kitty was angry and a little hurt; so I
yielded from fear of provoking further misunderstanding,
and we set out together toward Chota Simla.  We walked a
greater part of the way, and, according to our custom,
cantered from a mile or so below the convent to the stretch of
level road by the Sanjowlie Reservoir.  The wretched horses
appeared to fly, and my heart beat quicker and quicker as we
neared the crest of the ascent.  My mind had been full of
Mrs. Wessington all the afternoon; and every inch of the
Jakko road bore witness to our old-time walks and talks.
The boulders were full of it; the pines sung it aloud
overhead; the rain-fed torrent giggled and chuckled unseen over
the shameful story; and the wind in my ears chanted the
iniquity aloud.
</p>

<p>
As a fitting climax, in the middle of the level men call
the Lady's Mile, the horror was awaiting me.  No other
'rickshaw was in sight&mdash;only the four black and white
jhampanies, the yellow-paneled carriage, and the golden
head of a woman within&mdash;all apparently just as I had left
them eight months and one fortnight ago!  For an instant I
fancied that Kitty must see what I saw&mdash;we were so marvelously
sympathetic in all things.  Her next words undeceived
me&mdash;"Not a soul in sight!  Come along, Jack, and I'll race
you to the reservoir buildings!"  Her wiry little Arab was
off like a bird, my waler following close behind, and in this
order we dashed under the cliffs.  Half a minute brought us
within fifty yards of the 'rickshaw.  I pulled my waler and
fell back a little.  The 'rickshaw was directly in the middle
of the road; and once more the Arab passed through it, my
horse following.  "Jack!  Jack, dear!  Please forgive me,"
rang with a wail in my ears, and, after an interval: "It's all
a mistake, a hideous mistake!"
</p>

<p>
I spurred my horse like a man possessed.  When I turned
my head at the reservoir works, the black and white liveries
were still waiting&mdash;patiently waiting&mdash;under the gray
hillside, and the wind brought me a mocking echo of the words
I had just heard.  Kitty bantered me a good deal on my
silence throughout the remainder of the ride.  I had been
talking up till then wildly and at random.  To save my life
I could not speak naturally afterward, and from Sanjowlie to
the church wisely held my tongue.
</p>

<p>
I was to dine with the Mannerings that night, and had
barely time to canter home to dress.  On the road to Elysium
Hill I overheard two men talking together in the dusk&mdash;"It's
a curious thing," said one, "how completely all trace of
it disappeared.  You know my wife was insanely fond of the
woman (never could see anything in her myself), and wanted
me to pick up her old 'rickshaw and coolies if they were to be
got for love or money.  Morbid sort of fancy I call it; but
I've got to do what the Memsahib tells me.  Would you
believe that the man she hired it from tells me that all four
of the men&mdash;they were brothers&mdash;died of cholera on the way
to Hardwar, poor devils; and the 'rickshaw has been broken
up by the man himself.  Told me he never used a dead
Memsahib's 'rickshaw.  Spoiled his luck.  Queer notion,
wasn't it?  Fancy poor little Mrs. Wessington spoiling any
one's luck except her own!"  I laughed aloud at this point;
and my laugh jarred on me as I uttered it.  So there were
ghosts of 'rickshaws after all, and ghostly employments in
the other world!  How much did Mrs. Wessington give her
men?  What were their hours?  Where did they go?
</p>

<p>
And for visible answer to my last question I saw the
infernal thing blocking my path in the twilight.  The dead
travel fast, and by short cuts unknown to ordinary coolies.  I
laughed aloud a second time and checked my laughter
suddenly, for I was afraid I was going mad.  Mad to a certain
extent I must have been, for I recollect that I reined in my
horse at the head of the 'rickshaw, and politely wished
Mrs. Wessington "Good-evening."  Her answer was one I knew
only too well.  I listened to the end; and replied that I
had heard it all before, but should be delighted if she had
anything further to say.  Some malignant devil stronger than
I must have entered into me that evening, for I have a dim
recollection of talking the commonplaces of the day for five
minutes to the thing in front of me.
</p>

<p>
"Mad as a hatter, poor devil&mdash;or drunk.  Max, try and
get him to come home."
</p>

<p>
Surely that was not Mrs. Wessington's voice!  The two
men had overheard me speaking to the empty air, and had
returned to look after me.  They were very kind and
considerate, and from their words evidently gathered that I was
extremely drunk.  I thanked them confusedly and cantered
away to my hotel, there changed, and arrived at the
Mannerings' ten minutes late.  I pleaded the darkness of the
night as an excuse; was rebuked by Kitty for my
unlover-like tardiness; and sat down.
</p>

<p>
The conversation had already become general; and under
cover of it I was addressing some tender small-talk to my
sweetheart when I was aware that at the further end of the
table a short, red-whiskered man was describing, with much
broidery, his encounter with a man unknown that evening.
A few sentences convinced me that he was repeating the
incident of half an hour ago.  In the middle of the story he
looked round for applause, as professional story-tellers do,
caught my eyes, and straightway collapsed.  There was a
moment's awkward silence, and the red-whiskered man
muttered something to the effect that he had "forgotten the
rest," thereby sacrificing a reputation as a good story-teller
which he had built up for six seasons past.  I blessed him
from the bottom of my heart, and&mdash;went on with my fish.
</p>

<p>
In the fulness of time that dinner came to an end; and
with genuine regret I tore myself away from Kitty&mdash;as
certain as I was of my own existence that It would be waiting
for me outside the door.  The red-whiskered man, who had
been introduced to me as Dr. Heatherlegh of Simla,
volunteered to bear me company as far as our roads lay together.
I accepted his offer with gratitude.
</p>

<p>
My instinct had not deceived me.  It lay in readiness in
the Mall, and, in what seemed devilish mockery of our ways,
with a lighted head-lamp.  The red-whiskered man went to
the point at once, in a manner that showed he had been
thinking over it all dinner-time.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Pansay, what the deuce was the matter with you
this evening on the Elysium road?"  The suddenness of the
question wrenched an answer from me before I was aware.
</p>

<p>
"That!" said I, pointing to It.
</p>

<p>
"That may be either D. T. or Eyes for aught I know.
Now, you don't liquor.  I saw as much at dinner, so it can't
be D. T.  There's nothing whatever where you're pointing,
though you're sweating and trembling with fright like a
scared pony.  Therefore, I conclude that it's Eyes.  And I
ought to understand all about them.  Come along home with
me.  I'm on the Blessington lower road."
</p>

<p>
To my intense delight the 'rickshaw, instead of waiting
for us, kept about twenty yards ahead&mdash;and this, too, whether
we walked, trotted, or cantered.  In the course of that long
night ride I had told my companion almost as much as I
have told you here.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you've spoiled one of the best tales I've ever laid
tongue to," said he, "but I'll forgive you for the sake of
what you've gone through.  Now, come home and do what
I tell you; and when I've cured you, young man, let this be a
lesson to you to steer clear of women and indigestible food
till the day of your death."
</p>

<p>
The 'rickshaw kept steady in front; and my red-whiskered
friend seemed to derive great pleasure from my account of its
exact whereabout.
</p>

<p>
"Eyes, Pansay&mdash;all Eyes, Brain, and Stomach.  And the
greatest of these three is Stomach.  You've too much
conceited brain, too little stomach, and thoroughly unhealthy
eyes.  Get your stomach straight and the rest follows.  And
all that's French for a liver pill.  I'll take sole medical charge
of you from this hour! for you're too interesting a
phenomenon to be passed over."
</p>

<p>
By this time we were deep in the shadow of the Blessington
lower road and the 'rickshaw came to a dead stop under a
pine-clad, overhanging shale cliff.  Instinctively I halted, too,
giving my reason.  Heatherlegh rapped out an oath.
</p>

<p>
"Now, if you think I'm going to spend a cold night on the
hillside for the sake of a Stomach-cum-Brain-cum-Eye
illusion ... Lord ha' mercy!  What's that?"
</p>

<p>
There was a muffled report, a blinding smother of dust
just in front of us, a crack, the noise of rent boughs, and
about ten yards of the cliff-side&mdash;pines, undergrowth, and
all&mdash;slid down into the road below, completely blocking it up.
The uprooted trees swayed and tottered for a moment like
drunken giants in the gloom, and then fell prone among their
fellows with a thunderous crash.  Our two horses stood
motionless and sweating with fear.  As soon as the rattle of
falling earth and stone had subsided, my companion muttered:
"Man, if we'd gone forward we should have been ten feet
deep in our graves by now.  'There are more things in
heaven and earth&mdash;'  Come home, Pansay, and thank God.
I want a peg badly."
</p>

<p>
We retraced our way over the Church Ridge, and I arrived
at Dr. Heatherlegh's house shortly after midnight.
</p>

<p>
His attempts toward my cure commenced almost immediately,
and for a week I never left his sight.  Many a time
in the course of that week did I bless the good fortune which
had thrown me in contact with Simla's best and kindest
doctor.  Day by day my spirits grew lighter and more equable.
Day by day, too, I became more and more inclined to fall in
with Heatherlegh's "spectral illusion" theory, implicating
eyes, brain, and stomach.  I wrote to Kitty, telling her that
a slight sprain caused by a fall from my horse kept me
indoors for a few days; and that I should be recovered before
she had time to regret my absence.
</p>

<p>
Heatherlegh's treatment was simple to a degree.  It consisted
of liver pills, cold water baths, and strong exercise,
taken in the dusk or at early dawn&mdash;for, as he sagely
observed: "A man with a sprained ankle doesn't walk a dozen
miles a day, and your young woman might be wondering if
she saw you."
</p>

<p>
At the end of the week, after much examination of pupil
and pulse, and strict injunctions as to diet and pedestrianism,
Heatherlegh dismissed me as bruskly as he had taken
charge of me.  Here is his parting benediction: "Man, I
certify to your mental cure, and that's as much as to say I've
cured most of your bodily ailments.  Now, get your traps
out of this as soon as you can; and be off to make love
to Miss Kitty."
</p>

<p>
I was endeavoring to express my thanks for his kindness.
He cut me short.
</p>

<p>
"Don't think I did this because I like you.  I gather that
you've behaved like a blackguard all through.  But, all the
same, you're a phenomenon, and as queer a phenomenon as
you are a blackguard.  No!"&mdash;checking me a second time&mdash;"not
a rupee, please.  Go out and see if you can find the
eyes-brain-and-stomach business again.  I'll give you a lakh
for each time you see it."
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later I was in the Mannerings'
drawing-room with Kitty&mdash;drunk with the intoxication of present
happiness and the foreknowledge that I should never more
be troubled with Its hideous presence.  Strong in the sense
of my new-found security, I proposed a ride at once; and,
by preference, a canter round Jakko.
</p>

<p>
Never had I felt so well, so overladen with vitality and
mere animal spirits, as I did on the afternoon of the 30th
of April.  Kitty was delighted at the change in my appearance,
and complimented me on it in her delightfully frank
and outspoken manner.  We left the Mannerings' house
together, laughing and talking, and cantered along the Chota
Simla road as of old.
</p>

<p>
I was in haste to reach the Sanjowlie Reservoir and there
make my assurance doubly sure.  The horses did their best,
but seemed all too slow to my impatient mind.  Kitty was
astonished at my boisterousness.  "Why, Jack!" she cried at
last, "you are behaving like a child.  What are you doing?"
</p>

<p>
We were just below the convent, and from sheer wantonness
I was making my waler plunge and curvet across the
road as I tickled it with the loop of my riding-whip.
</p>

<p>
"Doing?" I answered; "nothing, dear.  That's just it.  If
you'd been doing nothing for a week except lie up, you'd be
as riotous as I.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Singing and murmuring in your feastful mirth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joying to feel yourself alive;<br>
  Lord over Nature, Lord of the visible Earth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of the senses five.'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
My quotation was hardly out of my lips before we had
rounded the corner above the convent, and a few yards
further on could see across to Sanjowlie.  In the centre of
the level road stood the black and white liveries, the
yellow-paneled 'rickshaw, and Mrs. Keith-Wessington.  I pulled
up, looked, rubbed my eyes, and, I believe, must have said
something.  The next thing I knew was that I was lying
face downward on the road, with Kitty kneeling above me
in tears.
</p>

<p>
"Has it gone, child?" I gasped.  Kitty only wept more
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Has what gone, Jack dear?  What does it all mean?
There must be a mistake somewhere, Jack.  A hideous
mistake."  Her last words brought me to my feet&mdash;mad&mdash;raving
for the time being.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there is a mistake somewhere," I repeated, "a
hideous mistake.  Come and look at It."
</p>

<p>
I have an indistinct idea that I dragged Kitty by the wrist
along the road up to where It stood, and implored her for
pity's sake to speak to It; to tell It that we were betrothed;
that neither death nor hell could break the tie between us;
and Kitty only knows how much more to the same effect.
Now and again I appealed passionately to the terror in the
'rickshaw to bear witness to all I had said, and to release me
from a torture that was killing me.  As I talked I suppose
I must have told Kitty of my old relations with Mrs. Wessington,
for I saw her listen intently with white face and
blazing eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mr. Pansay," she said, "that's quite enough.
Syce ghora láo."
</p>

<p>
The syces, impassive as Orientals always are, had come
up with the recaptured horses; and as Kitty sprang into her
saddle I caught hold of the bridle, entreating her to hear me
out and forgive.  My answer was the cut of her riding-whip
across my face from mouth to eye, and a word or two of
farewell that even now I can not write down.  So I judged, and
judged rightly, that Kitty knew all; and I staggered back
to the side of the 'rickshaw.  My face was cut and bleeding,
and the blow of the riding-whip had raised a livid blue wheal
on it.  I had no self-respect.  Just then, Heatherlegh, who
must have been following Kitty and me at a distance,
cantered up.
</p>

<p>
"Doctor," I said, pointing to my face, "here's Miss
Mannering's signature to my order of dismissal, and I'll thank
you for that lakh as soon as convenient."
</p>

<p>
Heatherlegh's face, even in my abject misery, moved me
to laughter.
</p>

<p>
"I'll stake my professional reputation&mdash;" he began.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a fool," I whispered.  "I've lost my life's
happiness and you'd better take me home."
</p>

<p>
As I spoke the 'rickshaw was gone.  Then I lost all
knowledge of what was passing.  The crest of Jakko seemed
to heave and roll like the crest of a cloud and fall in upon me.
</p>

<p>
Seven days later (on the 7th of May, that is to say) I was
aware that I was lying in Heatherlegh's room as weak as a
little child.  Heatherlegh was watching me intently from
behind the papers on his writing-table.  His first words were
not encouraging; but I was too far spent to be much moved
by them.
</p>

<p>
"Here's Miss Kitty has sent back your letters.  You
corresponded a good deal, you young people.  Here's a
packet that looks like a ring, and a cheerful sort of a note
from Mannering Papa, which I've taken the liberty of reading
and burning.  The old gentleman's not pleased with you."
</p>

<p>
"And Kitty?" I asked dully.
</p>

<p>
"Rather more drawn than her father from what she says.
By the same token you must have been letting out any
number of queer reminiscences just before I met you.  Says
that a man who would have behaved to a woman as you did
to Mrs. Wessington ought to kill himself out of sheer pity
for his kind.  She's a hot-headed little virago, your mash.
Will have it too that you were suffering from D. T. when
that row on the Jakko road turned up.  Says she'll die before
she ever speaks to you again."
</p>

<p>
I groaned and turned over on the other side.
</p>

<p>
"Now, you've got your choice, my friend.  This engagement
has to be broken off; and the Mannerings don't want
to be too hard on you.  Was it broken through D. T. or
epileptic fits?  Sorry I can't offer you a better exchange unless
you'd prefer hereditary insanity.  Say the word and I'll tell
'em it's fits.  All Simla knows about that scene on the Ladies'
Mile.  Come!  I'll give you five minutes to think over it."
</p>

<p>
During those five minutes I believe that I explored thoroughly
the lowest circles of the Inferno which it is permitted
man to tread on earth.  And at the same time I myself was
watching myself faltering through the dark labyrinths of
doubt, misery, and utter despair.  I wondered, as Heatherlegh
in his chair might have wondered, which dreadful
alternative I should adopt.  Presently I heard myself
answering in a voice that I hardly recognized:
</p>

<p>
"They're confoundedly particular about morality in these
parts.  Give 'em fits, Heatherlegh, and my love.  Now, let
me sleep a bit longer."
</p>

<p>
Then my two selves joined, and it was only I (half
crazed, devil-driven I) that tossed in my bed, tracing step
by step the history of the past month.
</p>

<p>
"But I am in Simla," I kept repeating to myself.  "I, Jack
Pansay, am in Simla, and there are no ghosts here.  It's
unreasonable of that woman to pretend there are.  Why
couldn't Agnes have left me alone?  I never did her any
harm.  It might just as well have been me as Agnes.  Only
I'd never have come back on purpose to kill her.  Why can't
I be left alone&mdash;left alone and happy?"
</p>

<p>
It was high noon when I first awoke; and the sun was
low in the sky before I slept&mdash;slept as the tortured criminal
sleeps on his rack, too worn to feel further pain.
</p>

<p>
Next day I could not leave my bed.  Heatherlegh told me
in the morning that he had received an answer from
Mr. Mannering, and that, thanks to his (Heatherlegh's) friendly
offices, the story of my affliction had traveled through the
length and breadth of Simla, where I was on all sides much
pitied.
</p>

<p>
"And that's rather more than you deserve," he concluded,
pleasantly, "though the Lord knows you've been going
through a pretty severe mill.  Never mind; we'll cure
you yet, you perverse phenomenon."
</p>

<p>
I declined firmly to be cured.  "You've been much too
good to me already, old man," said I; "but I don't think I
need trouble you further."
</p>

<p>
In my heart I knew that nothing Heatherlegh could do
would lighten the burden that had been laid upon me.
</p>

<p>
With that knowledge came also a sense of hopeless, impotent
rebellion against the unreasonableness of it all.  There
were scores of men no better than I whose punishments had
at least been reserved for another world; and I felt that it
was bitterly, cruelly unfair that I alone should have been
singled out for so hideous a fate.  This mood would in time
give place to another where it seemed that the 'rickshaw and
I were the only realities in a world of shadows; that Kitty
was a ghost; that Mannering, Heatherlegh, and all the other
men and women I knew were all ghosts; and the great, gray
hills themselves but vain shadows devised to torture me.
From mood to mood I tossed backward and forward for seven
weary days; my body growing daily stronger and stronger,
until the bedroom looking-glass told me that I had returned
to every day life, and was as other men once more.  Curiously
enough my face showed no signs of the struggle I had
gone through.  It was pale indeed, but as expressionless and
commonplace as ever.  I had expected some permanent
alteration&mdash;visible evidence of the disease that was eating me
away.  I found nothing.
</p>

<p>
On the 15th of May I left Heatherlegh's house at eleven
o'clock in the morning; and the instinct of the bachelor drove
me to the club.  There I found that every man knew my
story as told by Heatherlegh, and was, in clumsy fashion,
abnormally kind and attentive.  Nevertheless, I recognized
that for the rest of my natural life I should be among but
not of my fellows; and I envied very bitterly indeed the
laughing coolies on the Mall below.  I lunched at the club,
and at four o'clock wandered aimlessly down the Mall in the
vague hope of meeting Kitty.  Close to the band-stand the
black and white liveries joined me; and I heard Mrs. Wessington's
old appeal at my side.  I had been expecting this
ever since I came out; and was only surprised at her delay.
The phantom 'rickshaw and I went side by side along the
Chota Simla road in silence.  Close to the bazaar, Kitty and
a man on horseback overtook and passed us.  For any sign
she gave I might have been a dog in the road.  She did not
even pay me the compliment of quickening her pace; though
the rainy afternoon had served for an excuse.
</p>

<p>
So Kitty and her companion, and I and my ghostly light-o'-love,
crept round Jakko in couples.  The road was streaming
with water; the pines dripped like roof-pipes on the rocks
below, and the air was full of fine, driving rain.  Two or three
times I found myself saying to myself almost aloud: "I'm
Jack Pansay on leave at Simla&mdash;at Simla!  Everyday, ordinary
Simla.  I mustn't forget that&mdash;I mustn't forget that."  Then
I would try to recollect some of the gossip I had heard
at the club; the prices of So-and-So's horses&mdash;anything, in
fact, that related to the workaday Anglo-Indian world I
knew so well.  I even repeated the multiplication table rapidly
to myself, to make quite sure that I was not taking leave
of my senses.  It gave me much comfort; and must have
prevented my hearing Mrs. Wessington for a time.
</p>

<p>
Once more I wearily climbed the convent slope and
entered the level road.  Here Kitty and the man started off
at a canter, and I was left alone with Mrs. Wessington.
"Agnes," said I, "will you put back your hood and tell me
what it all means?"  The hood dropped noiselessly, and I
was face to face with my dead and buried mistress.  She
was wearing the dress in which I had last seen her alive;
carried the same tiny handkerchief in her right hand, and
the same card-case in her left.  (A woman eight months
dead with a card-case!)  I had to pin myself down to the
multiplication table, and to set both hands on the stone
parapet of the road, to assure myself that at least was
real.
</p>

<p>
"Agnes," I repeated, "for pity's sake tell me what it all
means."  Mrs. Wessington leaned forward, with that odd,
quick turn of the head I used to know so well, and spoke.
</p>

<p>
If my story had not already so madly overleaped the
bounds of all human belief I should apologize to you now.
As I know that no one&mdash;no, not even Kitty, for whom it is
written as some sort of justification of my conduct&mdash;will
believe me, I will go on.  Mrs. Wessington spoke and I walked
with her from the Sanjowlie road to the turning below the
Commander-in-chief's house as I might walk by the side of
any living woman's 'rickshaw, deep in conversation.  The
second and most tormenting of my moods of sickness had
suddenly laid hold upon me, and, like the prince in
Tennyson's poem, "I seemed to move amid a world of ghosts."  There
had been a garden-party at the commander-in-chief's,
and we two joined the crowd of homeward-bound folk.  As
I saw them then it seemed that they were the shadows&mdash;impalpable
fantastic shadows&mdash;that divided for Mrs. Wessington's
'rickshaw to pass through.  What we said during
the course of that weird interview I can not&mdash;indeed, I dare
not&mdash;tell.  Heatherlegh's comment would have been a short
laugh and a remark that I had been "mashing a
brain-eye-and-stomach chimera."  It was a ghastly and yet in some
indefinable way a marvelously dear experience.  Could it be
possible, I wondered, that I was in this life to woo a
second time the woman I had killed by my own neglect and
cruelty?
</p>

<p>
I met Kitty on the homeward road&mdash;a shadow among shadows.
</p>

<p>
If I were to describe all the incidents of the next
fortnight in their order, my story would never come to an end;
and your patience would be exhausted.  Morning after
morning and evening after evening the ghostly 'rickshaw and I
used to wander through Simla together.  Wherever I went
there the four black and white liveries followed me and bore
me company to and from my hotel.  At the theatre I found
them amid the crowd of yelling jhampanies; outside the
club veranda, after a long evening of whist; at the birthday
ball, waiting patiently for my reappearance; and in broad
daylight when I went calling.  Save that it cast no shadow,
the 'rickshaw was in every respect as real to look upon as
one of wood and iron.  More than once, indeed, I have had
to check myself from warning some hard-riding friend
against cantering over it.  More than once I have walked
down the Mall deep in conversation with Mrs. Wessington
to the unspeakable amazement of the passers-by.
</p>

<p>
Before I had been out and about a week I learned that
the "fit" theory had been discarded in favor of insanity.
However, I made no change in my mode of life.  I called,
rode, and dined out as freely as ever.  I had a passion for
the society of my kind which I had never felt before; I
hungered to be among the realities of life; and at the same
time I felt vaguely unhappy when I had been separated too
long from my ghostly companion.  It would be almost
impossible to describe my varying moods from the 15th of May
up to to-day.
</p>

<p>
The presence of the 'rickshaw filled me by turns with horror,
blind fear, a dim sort of pleasure, and utter despair.
I dared not leave Simla; and I knew that my stay there was
killing me.  I knew, moreover, that it was my destiny to die
slowly and a little every day.  My only anxiety was to get
the penance over as quietly as might be.  Alternately I
hungered for a sight of Kitty and watched her outrageous
flirtations with my successor&mdash;to speak more accurately, my
successors&mdash;with amused interest.  She was as much out of
my life as I was out of hers.  By day I wandered with
Mrs. Wessington almost content.  By night I implored Heaven to
let me return to the world as I used to know it.
</p>

<p>
Above all these varying moods lay the sensation of dull,
numbing wonder that the Seen and the Unseen should mingle
so strangely on this earth to hound one poor soul to its
grave.
</p>

<p class="thought">
. . . . . . . . . . . .
</p>

<p>
August 27.&mdash;Heatherlegh has been indefatigable in his
attendance on me; and only yesterday told me that I ought
to send in an application for sick leave.  An application to
escape the company of a phantom!  A request that the
government would graciously permit me to get rid of five ghosts
and an airy 'rickshaw by going to England!  Heatherlegh's
proposition moved me to almost hysterical laughter.  I told
him that I should await the end quietly at Simla; and I am
sure that the end is not far off.  Believe me that I dread its
advent more than any word can say; and I torture myself
nightly with a thousand speculations as to the manner of
my death.
</p>

<p>
Shall I die in my bed decently and as an English gentleman
should die; or, in one last walk on the Mall, will my
soul be wrenched from me to take its place forever and ever
by the side of that ghastly phantasm?  Shall I return to my
old lost allegiance in the next world, or shall I meet Agnes,
loathing her and bound to her side through all eternity?
Shall we two hover over the scene of our lives till the end of
Time?  As the day of my death draws nearer, the intense
horror that all living flesh feels toward escaped spirits from
beyond the grave grows more and more powerful.  It is an
awful thing to go down quick among the dead with scarcely
one-half of your life completed.  It is a thousand times
more awful to wait as I do in your midst, for I know not
what unimaginable terror.  Pity me, at least on the score of
my "delusion," for I know you will never believe what I
have written here.  Yet as surely as ever a man was done to
death by the Powers of Darkness I am that man.
</p>

<p>
In justice, too, pity her.  For as surely as ever woman
was killed by man, I killed Mrs. Wessington.  And the last
portion of my punishment is even now upon me.

THE ROLL-CALL OF THE REEF
</p>

<p class="t3">
By A. T. QUILLER-COUCH
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said my host, the quarryman, reaching
down the relics from their hook in the wall over
the chimneypiece; "they've hung here all my time,
and most of my father's.  The women won't touch
'em; they're afraid of the story.  So here they'll dangle, and
gather dust and smoke, till another tenant comes and tosses
'em out o' doors for rubbish.  Whew! 'tis coarse weather,
surely."
</p>

<p>
He went to the door, opened it, and stood studying the
gale that beat upon his cottage-front, straight from the
Manacle Reef.  The rain drove past him into the kitchen,
aslant like threads of gold silk in the shine of the wreck-wood
fire.  Meanwhile, by the same firelight, I examined the
relics on my knee.  The metal of each was tarnished out
of knowledge.  But the trumpet was evidently an old cavalry
trumpet, and the threads of its party-colored sling, though
fretted and dusty, still hung together.  Around the
side-drum, beneath its cracked brown varnish, I could hardly
trace a royal coat-of-arms and a legend running, "Per Mare
Per Terram"&mdash;the motto of the marines.  Its parchment,
though black and scented with wood-smoke, was limp and
mildewed; and I began to tighten up the straps&mdash;under
which the drumsticks had been loosely thrust&mdash;with the
idle purpose of trying if some music might be got out of
the old drum yet.
</p>

<p>
But as I turned it on my knee, I found the drum attached
to the trumpet-sling by a curious barrel-shaped padlock, and
paused to examine this.  The body of the lock was composed
of half a dozen brass rings, set accurately edge to
edge; and, rubbing the brass with my thumb, I saw that
each of the six had a series of letters engraved around it.
</p>

<p>
I knew the trick of it, I thought.  Here was one of those
word padlocks, once so common; only to be opened by getting
the rings to spell a certain word, which the dealer
confides to you.
</p>

<p>
My host shut and barred the door, and came back to the
hearth.
</p>

<p>
"'Twas just such a wind&mdash;east by south&mdash;that brought
in what you've got between your hands.  Back in the year
'nine, it was; my father has told me the tale a score o' times.
You're twisting round the rings, I see.  But you'll never
guess the word.  Parson Kendall, he made the word, and
he locked down a couple o' ghosts in their graves with it;
and when his time came he went to his own grave and took
the word with him."
</p>

<p>
"Whose ghosts, Matthew?"
</p>

<p>
"You want the story, I see, sir.  My father could tell it
better than I can.  He was a young man in the year 'nine,
unmarried at the time, and living in this very cottage, just
as I be.  That's how he came to get mixed up with the tale."
</p>

<p>
He took a chair, lighted a short pipe, and went on, with
his eyes fixed on the dancing violet flames:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he'd ha' been about thirty year old in January,
eighteen 'nine.  The storm got up in the night o' the
twenty-first o' that month.  My father was dressed and out long
before daylight; he never was one to bide in bed, let be that
the gale by this time was pretty near lifting the thatch over
his head.  Besides which, he'd fenced a small 'taty-patch that
winter, down by Lowland Point, and he wanted to see if it
stood the night's work.  He took the path across Gunner's
Meadow&mdash;where they buried most of the bodies afterward.
The wind was right in his teeth at the time, and once on the
way (he's told me this often) a great strip of oarweed came
flying through the darkness and fetched him a slap on the
cheek like a cold hand.  But he made shift pretty well till
he got to Lowland, and then had to drop upon hands and
knees and crawl, digging his fingers every now and then into
the shingle to hold on, for he declared to me that the
stones, some of them as big as a man's head, kept rolling
and driving past till it seemed the whole foreshore was
moving westward under him.  The fence was gone, of course;
not a stick left to show where it stood; so that, when first
he came to the place, he thought he must have missed his
bearings.  My father, sir, was a very religious man; and if
he reckoned the end of the world was at hand&mdash;there in the
great wind and night, among the moving stones&mdash;you may
believe he was certain of it when he heard a gun fired, and,
with the same, saw a flame shoot up out of the darkness to
windward, making a sudden fierce light in all the place
about.  All he could find to think or say was, 'The Second
Coming!  The Second Coming!  The Bridegroom cometh,
and the wicked He will toss like a ball into a large country';
and being already upon his knees, he just bowed his head
and 'bided, saying this over and over.
</p>

<p>
"But by'm by, between two squalls, he made bold to lift
his head and look, and then by the light&mdash;a bluish color
'twas&mdash;he saw all the coast clear away to Manacle Point,
and off the Manacles in the thick of the weather, a
sloop-of-war with topgallants housed, driving stern foremost
toward the reef.  It was she, of course, that was burning the
flare.  My father could see the white streak and the ports
of her quite plain as she rose to it, a little outside the
breakers, and he guessed easy enough that her captain had
just managed to wear ship and was trying to force her nose
to the sea with the help of her small bower anchor and the
scrap or two of canvas that hadn't yet been blown out of
her.  But while he looked, she fell off, giving her broadside
to it foot by foot, and drifting back on the breakers around
Carn Du and the Varses.  The rocks lie so thick thereabout
that 'twas a toss up which she struck first; at any rate, my
father couldn't tell at the time, for just then the flare died
down and went out.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, he turned then in the dark and started back
for Coverack to cry the dismal tidings&mdash;though well
knowing ship and crew to be past any hope, and as he turned
the wind lifted him and tossed him forward 'like a ball,' as
he'd been saying, and homeward along the foreshore.  As
you know, 'tis ugly work, even by daylight, picking your
way among the stones there, and my father was prettily
knocked about at first in the dark.  But by this 'twas nearer
seven than six o'clock, and the day spreading.  By the time
he reached North Corner, a man could see to read print;
hows'ever, he looked neither out to sea nor toward Coverack,
but headed straight for the first cottage&mdash;the same that
stands above North Corner to-day.  A man named Billy
Ede lived there then, and when my father burst into the
kitchen bawling, 'Wreck! wreck!' he saw Billy Ede's wife,
Ann, standing there in her clogs with a shawl over her
head, and her clothes wringing wet.
</p>

<p>
"'Save the chap!' says Billy Ede's wife, Ann.  'What d'ee
mean by crying stale fish at that rate?'
</p>

<p>
"'But 'tis a wreck, I tell 'ee.'
</p>

<p>
"'I've a-zeed 'n, too; and so has every one with an eye
in his head.'
</p>

<p>
"And with that she pointed straight over my father's
shoulder, and he turned; and there, close under Dolor Point,
at the end of Coverack town, he saw another wreck washing,
and the point black with people, like emmets, running to
and fro in the morning light.  While he stood staring at her,
he heard a trumpet sounded on board, the notes coming in
little jerks, like a bird rising against the wind; but faintly,
of course, because of the distance and the gale
blowing&mdash;though this had dropped a little.
</p>

<p>
"'She's a transport,' said Billy Ede's wife, Ann, 'and full
of horse-soldiers, fine long men.  When she struck they
must ha' pitched the horses over first to lighten the ship,
for a score of dead horses had washed in afore I left, half
an hour back.  An' three or four soldiers, too&mdash;fine long
corpses in white breeches and jackets of blue and gold.  I
held the lantern to one.  Such a straight young man!'
</p>

<p>
"My father asked her about the trumpeting.
</p>

<p>
"'That's the queerest bit of all.  She was burnin' a light
when me an' my man joined the crowd down there.  All her
masts had gone; whether they carried away, or were cut
away to ease her, I don't rightly know.  Her keelson was
broke under her and her bottom sagged and stove, and she
had just settled down like a sitting hen&mdash;just the leastest
list to starboard; but a man could stand there easy.  They
had rigged up ropes across her, from bulwark to bulwark,
an' beside these the men were mustered, holding on like
grim death whenever the sea made a clean breach over
them, an' standing up like heroes as soon as it passed.
The captain an' the officers were clinging to the rail of
the quarterdeck, all in their golden uniforms, waiting for the
end as if 'twas King George they expected.  There was
no way to help, for she lay right beyond cast of line, though
our folk tried it fifty times.  And beside them clung a
trumpeter, a whacking big man, an' between the heavy seas he
would lift his trumpet with one hand, and blow a call; and
every time he blew the men gave a cheer.  There [she
says]&mdash;hark 'ee now&mdash;there he goes agen!  But you won't hear
no cheering any more, for few are left to cheer, and their
voices weak.  Bitter cold the wind is, and I reckon it numbs
their grip o' the ropes, for they were dropping off fast with
every sea when my man sent me home to get his breakfast.
Another wreck, you say?  Well, there's no hope for the
tender dears, if 'tis the Manacles.  You'd better run down
and help yonder; though 'tis little help any man can give.
Not one came in alive while I was there.  The tide's flowing,
an' she won't hold together another hour, they say.'
</p>

<p>
"Well, sure enough, the end was coming fast when my
father got down to the point.  Six men had been cast up
alive, or just breathing&mdash;a seaman and five troopers.  The
seaman was the only one that had breath to speak; and
while they were carrying him into the town, the word went
round that the ship's name was the 'Despatch,' transport,
homeward-bound from Corunna, with a detachment of the
Seventh Hussars, that had been fighting out there with Sir
John Moore.  The seas had rolled her further over by this
time, and given her decks a pretty sharp slope; but a dozen
men still held on, seven by the ropes near the ship's waist,
a couple near the break of the poop, and three on the
quarterdeck.  Of these three my father made out one to be the
skipper; close by him clung an officer in full regimentals&mdash;his
name, they heard after, was Captain Duncanfield; and
last came the tall trumpeter; and if you'll believe me, the
fellow was making shift there, at the very last, to blow 'God
Save the King.'  What's more, he got to 'Send us victorious,'
before an extra big sea came bursting across and washed
them off the deck&mdash;every man but one of the pair beneath
the poop&mdash;and he dropped his hold before the next wave;
being stunned, I reckon.  The others went out of sight at
once, but the trumpeter&mdash;being, as I said, a powerful man
as well as a tough swimmer&mdash;rose like a duck, rode out a
couple of breakers, and came in on the crest of the third.
The folks looked to see him broke like an egg at their very
feet; but when the smother cleared, there he was, lying face
downward on a ledge below them; and one of the men that
happened to have a rope round him&mdash;I forget the fellow's
name, if I ever heard it&mdash;jumped down and grabbed him by
the ankle as he began to slip back.  Before the next big
sea, the pair were hauled high enough to be out of harm,
and another heave brought them up to grass.  Quick work,
but master trumpeter wasn't quite dead; nothing worse than
a cracked head and three staved ribs.  In twenty minutes or
so they had him in bed, with the doctor to tend him.
</p>

<p>
"Now was the time&mdash;nothing being left alive upon the
transport&mdash;for my father to tell of the sloop he'd seen
driving upon the Manacles.  And when he got a hearing, though
the most were set upon salvage, and believed a wreck in the
hand, so to say, to be worth half a dozen they couldn't see,
a good few volunteered to start off with him and have a
look.  They crossed Lowland Point; no ship to be seen on
the Manacles nor anywhere upon the sea.  One or two was
for calling my father a liar.  'Wait till we come to Dean
Point,' said he.  Sure enough, on the far side of Dean Point
they found the sloop's mainmast washing about with half
a dozen men lashed to it, men in red jackets, every mother's
son drowned and staring; and a little further on, just under
the Dean, three or four bodies cast up on the shore, one of
them a small drummer-boy, side-drum and all; and near by
part of a ship's gig, with 'H.M.S. Primrose' cut on the
stern-board.  From this point on the shore was littered thick with
wreckage and dead bodies&mdash;the most of them marines in
uniform&mdash;and in Godrevy Cove, in particular, a heap of
furniture from the captain's cabin, and among it a water-tight
box, not much damaged, and full of papers, by which, when
it came to be examined, next day, the wreck was easily
made out to be the 'Primrose,' of eighteen guns, outward
bound from Portsmouth, with a fleet of transports for the
Spanish war&mdash;thirty sail, I've heard, but I've never heard
what became of them.  Being handled by merchant skippers,
no doubt they rode out the gale, and reached the Tagus
safe and sound.  Not but what the captain of the 'Primrose'&mdash;Mein
was his name&mdash;did quite right to try and club-haul
his vessel when he found himself under the land; only he
never ought to have got there, if he took proper soundings.
But it's easy talking.
</p>

<p>
"The 'Primrose,' sir, was a handsome vessel&mdash;for her size
one of the handsomest in the King's service&mdash;and newly
fitted out at Plymouth Dock.  So the boys had brave pickings
from her in the way of brass-work, ship's instruments,
and the like, let alone some barrels of stores not much
spoiled.  They loaded themselves with as much as they
could carry, and started for home, meaning to make a
second journey before the preventive men got wind of their
doings, and came to spoil the fun.  'Hullo!' says my father,
and dropped his gear, 'I do believe there's a leg moving?' and
running fore, he stooped over the small drummer-boy that
I told you about.  The poor little chap was lying there,
with his face a mass of bruises, and his eyes closed; but he
had shifted one leg an inch or two, and was still breathing.
So my father pulled out a knife, and cut him free from
his drum&mdash;that was lashed on to him with a double turn of
Manila rope&mdash;and took him up and carried him along here
to this very room that we're sitting in.  He lost a good deal
by this; for when he went back to fetch the bundle he'd
dropped, the preventive men had got hold of it, and were
thick as thieves along the foreshore; so that 'twas only by
paying one or two to look the other way that he picked up
anything worth carrying off: which you'll allow to be hard,
seeing that he was the first man to give news of the wreck.
</p>

<p>
"Well, the inquiry was held, of course, and my father
gave evidence, and for the rest they had to trust to the
sloop's papers, for not a soul was saved besides the
drummer-boy, and he was raving in a fever, brought on by the
cold and the fright.  And the seaman and the five troopers
gave evidence about the loss of the 'Despatch.'  The tall
trumpeter, too, whose ribs were healing, came forward and
kissed the book; but somehow his head had been hurt in
coming ashore, and he talked foolish-like, and 'twas easy
seen he would never be a proper man again.  The others
were taken up to Plymouth, and so went their ways; but the
trumpeter stayed on in Coverack; and King George, finding
he was fit for nothing, sent him down a trifle of a pension
after a while&mdash;enough to keep him in board and lodging,
with a bit of tobacco over.
</p>

<p>
"Now the first time that this man&mdash;William Tallifer he
called himself&mdash;met with the drummer-boy, was about a fortnight
after the little chap had bettered enough to be allowed
a short walk out of doors, which he took, if you please, in
full regimentals.  There never was a soldier so proud of his
dress.  His own suit had shrunk a brave bit with the salt
water; but into ordinary frock an' corduroys he declared
he would not get, not if he had to go naked the rest of his
life; so my father&mdash;being a good-natured man, and handy
with the needle&mdash;turned to and repaired damages with a
piece or two of scarlet cloth cut from the jacket of one of
the drowned Marines.  Well, the poor little chap chanced
to be standing, in this rig out, down by the gate of Gunner's
Meadow, where they had buried two score and over of his
comrades.  The morning was a fine one, early in March
month; and along came the cracked trumpeter, likewise
taking a stroll.
</p>

<p>
"'Hullo!' says he; 'good mornin'!  And what might you
be doin' here?'
</p>

<p>
"'I was a-wishin',' says the boy, 'I had a pair o'
drumsticks.  Our lads were buried yonder without so much as a
drum tapped or a musket fired; and that's not Christian
burial for British soldiers.'
</p>

<p>
"'Phut!' says the trumpeter, and spat on the ground; 'a
parcel of Marines!'
</p>

<p>
"The boy eyed him a second or so, and answered up: 'If
I'd a tav of turf handy, I'd bung it at your mouth, you greasy
cavalryman, and learn you to speak respectful of your
betters.  The Marines are the handiest body o' men in the
service.'
</p>

<p>
"The trumpeter looked down on him from the height of
six-foot two, and asked: 'Did they die well?'
</p>

<p>
"'They died very well.  There was a lot of running to
and fro at first, and some of the men began to cry, and a
few to strip off their clothes.  But when the ship fell off
for the last time, Captain Mein turned and said something
to Major Griffiths, the commanding officer on board, and
the Major called out to me to beat to quarters.  It might
have been for a wedding, he sang it out so cheerful.  We'd
had word already that 'twas to be parade order; and the
men fell in as trim and decent as if they were going to
church.  One or two even tried to shave at the last
moment.  The Major wore his medals.  One of the seamen,
seeing I had work to keep the drum steady&mdash;the sling being a
bit loose for me, and the wind what you remember&mdash;lashed it
tight with a piece of rope; and that saved my life afterward,
a drum being as good as a cork until it's stove.  I kept
beating away until every man was on deck; and then the Major
formed them up and told them to die like British soldiers,
and the chaplain was in the middle of a prayer when she
struck.  In ten minutes she was gone.  That was how they
died, cavalryman.'
</p>

<p>
"'And that was very well done, drummer of the Marines.
What's your name?'
</p>

<p>
"'John Christian.'
</p>

<p>
"'Mine's William George Tallifer, trumpeter, of the Seventh
Light Dragoons&mdash;the Queen's Own.  I played "God Save
the King" while our men were drowning.  Captain Duncanfield
told me to sound a call or two, to put them in heart;
but that matter of "God save the King" was a notion of my
own.  I won't say anything to hurt the feelings of a Marine,
even if he's not much over five-foot tall; but the Queen's Own
Hussars is a tearin' fine regiment.  As between horse and
foot, 'tis a question o' which gets a chance.  All the way
from Sahagun to Corunna 'twas we that took and gave the
knocks&mdash;at Mayorga and Rueda, and Bennyventy.'&mdash;The reason,
sir, I can speak the names so pat, is that my father
learnt 'em by heart afterward from the trumpeter, who was
always talking about Mayorga and Rueda and Bennyventy.'&mdash;We
made the rear-guard, under General Paget; and drove
the French every time; and all the infantry did was to sit
about in wine-shops till we whipped 'em out, an' steal an'
straggle an' play the tom-fool in general.  And when it
came to a stand-up fight at Corunna, 'twas we that had to
stay seasick aboard the transports, an' watch the infantry
in the thick o' the caper.  Very well they behaved,
too&mdash;specially the Fourth Regiment, an' the Forty-Second
Highlanders, an' the Dirty Half-Hundred.  Oh, ay; they're decent
regiments, all three.  But the Queen's Own Hussars is a
tearin' fine regiment.  So you played on your drum when the
ship was goin' down?  Drummer John Christian, I'll have to
get you a new pair of sticks.'
</p>

<p>
"The very next day the trumpeter marched into Helston,
and got a carpenter there to turn him a pair of box-wood
drumsticks for the boy.  And this was the beginning of one
of the most curious friendships you ever heard tell of.
Nothing delighted the pair more than to borrow a boat off my
father and pull out to the rocks where the 'Primrose' and the
'Despatch' had struck and sunk; and on still days 'twas
pretty to hear them out there off the Manacles, the drummer
playing his tattoo&mdash;for they always took their music with
them&mdash;and the trumpeter practising calls, and making his
trumpet speak like an angel.  But if the weather turned
roughish, they'd be walking together and talking; leastwise
the youngster listened while the other discoursed about Sir
John's campaign in Spain and Portugal, telling how each
little skirmish befell; and of Sir John himself, and General
Baird, and General Paget, and Colonel Vivian, his own
commanding officer, and what kind of men they were; and of the
last bloody stand-up at Corunna, and so forth, as if neither
could have enough.
</p>

<p>
"But all this had to come to an end in the late summer,
for the boy, John Christian, being now well and strong again,
must go up to Plymouth to report himself.  'Twas his own
wish (for I believe King George had forgotten all about him),
but his friend wouldn't hold him back.  As for the
trumpeter, my father had made an arrangement to take him on as
lodger, as soon as the boy left; and on the morning fixed
for the start, he was up at the door here by five o'clock, with
his trumpet slung by his side, and all the rest of his belongings
in a small valise.  A Monday morning it was, and after
breakfast he had fixed to walk with the boy some way on the
road toward Helston, where the coach started.  My father
left them at breakfast together, and went out to meat the
pig, and do a few odd morning jobs of that sort.  When he
came back, the boy was still at table, and the trumpeter sat
with the rings in his hands, hitched together just as they be
at this moment.
</p>

<p>
"'Look at this,' he says to my father, showing him the
lock.  'I picked it up off a starving brass-worker in Lisbon,
and it is not one of your common locks that one word of six
letters will open at any time.  There's janius in this lock;
for you've only to make the rings spell any six-letter word
you please and snap down the lock upon that, and never
a soul can open it&mdash;not the maker, even&mdash;until somebody
comes along that knows the word you snapped it on.  Now
Johnny here's goin', and he leaves his drum behind him; for,
though he can make pretty music on it, the parchment sags
in wet weather, by reason of the sea-water getting at it;
an' if he carries it to Plymouth, they'll only condemn it and
give him another.  And, as for me, I shan't have the heart to
put lip to the trumpet any more when Johnny's gone.  So
we've chosen a word together, and locked 'em together upon
that; and, by your leave, I'll hang 'em here together on the
hook over your fireplace.  Maybe Johnny'll come back;
maybe not.  Maybe, if he comes, I'll be dead an' gone, and
he'll take 'em apart an' try their music for old sake's sake.
But if he never comes, nobody can separate 'em; for nobody
besides knows the word.  And if you marry and have sons,
you can tell 'em that here are tied together the souls of
Johnny Christian, drummer of the Marines, and William
George Tallifer, once trumpeter of the Queen's Own
Hussars.  Amen.'
</p>

<p>
"With that he hung the two instruments 'pon the hook
there; and the boy stood up and thanked my father and
shook hands; and the pair went out of the door, toward
Helston.
</p>

<p>
"Somewhere on the road they took leave of one another;
but nobody saw the parting, nor heard what was said
between them.  About three in the afternoon the trumpeter
came walking back over the hill; and by the time my father
came home from the fishing, the cottage was tidied up, and
the tea ready, and the whole place shining like a new pin.
From that time for five years he lodged here with my father,
looking after the house and tilling the garden.  And all the
while he was steadily failing; the hurt in his head spreading,
in a manner, to his limbs.  My father watched the feebleness
growing on him, but said nothing.  And from first to last
neither spake a word about the drummer, John Christian; nor
did any letter reach them, nor word of his doings.
</p>

<p>
"The rest of the tale you're free to believe, sir, or not, as
you please.  It stands upon my father's words, and he always
declared he was ready to kiss the Book upon it, before judge
and jury.  He said, too, that he never had the wit to make up
such a yarn; and he defied any one to explain about the lock,
in particular, by any other tale.  But you shall judge for
yourself.
</p>

<p>
"My father said that about three o'clock in the morning,
April fourteenth, of the year 'fourteen, he and William Tallifer
were sitting here, just as you and I, sir, are sitting now.
My father had put on his clothes a few minutes before, and
was mending his spiller by the light of the horn lantern,
meaning to set off before daylight to haul the trammel.  The
trumpeter hadn't been to bed at all.  Toward the last he
mostly spent his nights (and his days, too) dozing in the
elbow-chair where you sit at this minute.  He was dozing
then (my father said) with his chin dropped forward on
his chest, when a knock sounded upon the door, and the
door opened, and in walked an upright young man in scarlet
regimentals.
</p>

<p>
"He had grown a brave bit, and his face the color of
wood-ashes; but it was the drummer, John Christian.  Only
his uniform was different from the one he used to wear, and
the figures '38' shone in brass upon his collar.
</p>

<p>
"The drummer walked past my father as if he never saw
him, and stood by the elbow-chair and said:
</p>

<p>
"'Trumpeter, trumpeter, are you one with us?'
</p>

<p>
"And the trumpeter just lifted the lids of his eyes, and
answered: 'How should I not be one with you, drummer
Johnny&mdash;Johnny boy?  If you come, I count; if you march,
I mark time; until the discharge comes.'
</p>

<p>
"'The discharge has come to-night,' said the drummer;
'and the word is Corunna no longer.' And stepping to the
chimney-place, he unhooked the drum and trumpet, and began
to twist the brass rings of the lock, spelling the word
aloud, so&mdash;'C-O-R-U-N-A.'  When he had fixed the last
letter, the padlock opened in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"'Did you know, trumpeter, that, when I came to Plymouth,
they put me into a line regiment?'
</p>

<p>
"'The 38th is a good regiment,' answered the old Hussar,
still in his dull voice; 'I went back with them from
Sahagun to Corunna.  At Corunna they stood in General
Fraser's division, on the right.  They behaved well."
</p>

<p>
"'But I'd fain see the Marines again,' says the drummer,
handing him the trumpet; 'and you, you shall call once more
for the Queen's Own.  Matthew,' he says, suddenly, turning
on my father&mdash;and when he turned, my father saw for the
first time that his scarlet jacket had a round hole by the
breast-bone, and that the blood was welling there&mdash;'Matthew,
we shall want your boat.'
</p>

<p>
"Then my father rose on his legs like a man in a dream,
while they two slung on, the one his drum, and t'other his
trumpet.  He took the lantern and went quaking before them
down to the shore, and they breathed heavily behind him;
and they stepped into his boat, and my father pushed off.
</p>

<p>
"'Row you first for Dolor Point,' says the drummer.  So
my father rowed them past the white houses of Coverack to
Dolor Point, and there, at a word, lay on his oars.  And the
trumpeter, William Tallifer, put his trumpet to his mouth
and sounded the reveille.  The music of it was like rivers
running.
</p>

<p>
"'They will follow,' said the drummer.  'Matthew, pull
you now for the Manacles.'
</p>

<p>
"So my father pulled for the Manacles, and came to an
easy close outside Carn Du.  And the drummer took his
sticks and beat a tattoo, there by the edge of the reef; and
the music of it was like a rolling chariot.
</p>

<p>
"'That will do,' says he, breaking off; 'they will follow.
Pull now for the shore under Gunner's Meadow.'
</p>

<p>
"Then my father pulled for the shore and ran his boat
in under Gunner's Meadow.  And they stepped out, all three,
and walked up to the meadow.  By the gate the drummer
halted, and began his tattoo again, looking out toward the
darkness over the sea.
</p>

<p>
"And while the drum beat, and my father held his breath,
there came up out of the sea and the darkness a troop of
many men, horse and foot, and formed up among the graves;
and others rose out of the graves and formed up&mdash;drowned
Marines with bleached faces, and pale Hussars, riding their
horses, all lean and shadowy.  There was no clatter of hoofs
or accoutrements, my father said, but a soft sound all the
while like the beating of a bird's wing; and a black shadow
lay like a pool about the feet of all.  The drummer stood
upon a little knoll just inside the gate, and beside him the tall
trumpeter, with hand on hip, watching them gather; and behind
them both my father, clinging to the gate.  When no more
came, the drummer stopped playing, and said, 'Call the roll.'
</p>

<p>
"Then the trumpeter stepped toward the end man of the
rank and called, 'Troop Sergeant-Major Thomas Irons,' and
the man answered in a thin voice, 'Here.'
</p>

<p>
"'Troop Sergeant-Major Thomas Irons, how is it with
you?'
</p>

<p>
"The man answered, 'How should it be with me?  When
I was young, I betrayed a girl; and when I was grown, I
betrayed a friend, and for these I must pay.  But I died as a
man ought.  God save the King!'
</p>

<p>
"The trumpeter called to the next man, 'Trooper Henry
Buckingham,' and the next man answered, 'Here.'
</p>

<p>
"'Trooper Henry Buckingham, how is it with you?'
</p>

<p>
"'How should it be with me?  I was a drunkard, and I
stole, and in Lugo, in a wine-shop, I killed a man.  But I
died as a man should.  God save the King!'
</p>

<p>
"So the trumpeter went down the line; and when he had
finished, the drummer took it up, hailing the dead Marines in
their order.  Each man answered to his name, and each
man ended with 'God save the King!'  When all were hailed,
the drummer stepped back to his mound, and called:
</p>

<p>
"'It is well.  You are content, and we are content to join
you.  Wait, now, a little while.'
</p>

<p>
"With this he turned and ordered my father to pick up
the lantern, and lead the way back.  As my father picked it
up, he heard the ranks of the dead men cheer and call, 'God
save the King!' all together, and saw them waver and fade
back into the dark, like a breath fading off a pane.
</p>

<p>
"But when they came back here to the kitchen, and my
father set the lantern down, it seemed they'd both forgot
about him.  For the drummer turned in the lantern-light&mdash;and
my father could see the blood still welling out of the
hole in his breast&mdash;and took the trumpet-sling from around
the other's neck, and locked drum and trumpet together
again, choosing the letters on the lock very carefully.  While
he did this, he said:
</p>

<p>
"'The word is no more Corunna, but Bayonne.  As you
left out an "n" in Corunna, so must I leave out an "n" in
Bayonne.' And before snapping the padlock, he spelt out
the word slowly&mdash;'B-A-Y-O-N-E.'  After that, he used no
more speech; but turned and hung the two instruments back
on the hook; and then took the trumpeter by the arm; and
the pair walked out into the darkness, glancing neither to
right nor left.
</p>

<p>
"My father was on the point of following, when he heard
a sort of sigh behind him; and there, sitting in the
elbow-chair, was the very trumpeter he had just seen walk out by
the door!  If my father's heart jumped before, you may
believe it jumped quicker now.  But after a bit, he went
up to the man asleep in the chair and put a hand
upon him.  It was the trumpeter in flesh and blood that he
touched; but though the flesh was warm, the trumpeter
was dead.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, they buried him three days after; and at first
my father was minded to say nothing about his dream (as he
thought it).  But the day after the funeral, he met Parson
Kendall coming from Helston market; and the parson called
out: 'Have 'ee heard the news the coach brought down this
mornin'?'  'What news?' says my father.  'Why, that peace
is agreed upon.'  'None too soon,' says my father.  'Not soon
enough for our poor lads at Bayonne,' the parson answered.
'Bayonne!' cries my father, with a jump.  'Why, yes;' and
the parson told him all about a great sally the French had
made on the night of April 13th.  'Do you happen to know if
the 38th Regiment was engaged?' my father asked.  'Come,
now,' said Parson Kendall, 'I didn't know you was so well up
in the campaign.  But, as it happens, I do know that the
38th was engaged, for 'twas they that held a cottage and
stopped the French advance.'
</p>

<p>
"Still my father held his tongue; and when, a week later,
he walked into Helston and bought a 'Mercury' off the
Sherborne rider, and got the landlord of the 'Angel' to
spell out the list of killed and wounded, sure enough, there
among the killed was Drummer John Christian, of the
38th Foot.
</p>

<p>
"After this there was nothing for a religious man but to
make a clean breast.  So my father went up to Parson Kendall,
and told the whole story.  The parson listened, and put
a question or two, and then asked:
</p>

<p>
"'Have you tried to open the lock since that night?'
</p>

<p>
"'I haven't dared to touch it,' says my father.
</p>

<p>
"'Then come along and try.'  When the parson came
to the cottage here, he took the things off the hook and tried
the lock.  'Did he say "Bayonne?"  The word has seven letters.'
</p>

<p>
"'Not if you spell it with one "n" as he did,' says my
father.
</p>

<p>
"The parson spelt it out&mdash;'B-A-Y-O-N-E.'  'Whew!' says
he, for the lock had fallen open in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"He stood considering it a moment, and then he says:
'I tell you what.  I shouldn't blab this all round the parish,
if I was you.  You won't get no credit for truth-telling, and a
miracle's wasted on a set of fools.  But if you like, I'll shut
down the lock again upon a holy word that no one but me
shall know, and neither drummer nor trumpeter, dead or
alive, shall frighten the secret out of me.'
</p>

<p>
"'I wish to heaven you would, parson,' said my father.
</p>

<p>
"The parson chose the holy word there and then, and shut
the lock back upon it, and hung the drum and trumpet back
in their place.  He is gone long since, taking the word with
him.  And till the lock is broken by force, nobody will ever
separate those two."

THE HOUSE AND THE BRAIN
</p>

<p class="t3">
By LORD EDWARD BULWER-LYTTON
</p>

<p>
A friend of mine, who is a man of letters and a
philosopher, said to me one day, as if between
jest and earnest: "Fancy! since we last met,
I have discovered a haunted house in the midst
of London."
</p>

<p>
"Really haunted?&mdash;and by what?&mdash;ghosts?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I can't answer that question; all I know is this:
six weeks ago my wife and I were in search of a furnished
apartment.  Passing a quiet street, we saw on the window of
one of the houses a bill, 'Apartments, Furnished.'  The
situation suited us: we entered the house&mdash;liked the
rooms&mdash;engaged them by the week&mdash;and left them the third day.
No power on earth could have reconciled my wife to stay
longer; and I don't wonder at it."
</p>

<p>
"What did you see?"
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me&mdash;I have no desire to be ridiculed as a superstitious
dreamer&mdash;nor, on the other hand, could I ask you to
accept on my affirmation what you would hold to be incredible
without the evidence of your own senses.  Let me only
say this, it was not so much what we saw or heard (in which
you might fairly suppose that we were the dupes of our own
excited fancy, or the victims of imposture in others) that
drove us away, as it was an undefinable terror which seized
both of us whenever we passed by the door of a certain
unfurnished room, in which we neither saw nor heard
anything.  And the strangest marvel of all was, that for once
in my life I agreed with my wife, silly woman though she
be&mdash;and allowed, after the third night, that it was impossible
to stay a fourth in that house.  Accordingly, on the fourth
morning I summoned the woman who kept the house and
attended on us, and told her that the rooms did not quite
suit us, and we would not stay out our week.  She said,
dryly: 'I know why; you have stayed longer than any other
lodger.  Few ever stayed a second night; none before you a
third.  But I take it they have been very kind to you."
</p>

<p>
"'They&mdash;who?' I asked, affecting to smile.
</p>

<p>
"'Why, they who haunt the house, whoever they are.  I
don't mind them; I remember them many years ago, when
I lived in this house, not as a servant; but I know they will
be the death of me some day.  I don't care&mdash;I'm old, and
must die soon anyhow; and then I shall be with them, and
in this house still.'  The woman spoke with so dreary a
calmness that really it was a sort of awe that prevented my
conversing with her further.  I paid for my week, and too
happy were my wife and I to get off so cheaply."
</p>

<p>
"You excite my curiosity," said I; "nothing I should like
better than to sleep in a haunted house.  Pray give me the
address of the one which you left so ignominiously."
</p>

<p>
My friend gave me the address; and when we parted, I
walked straight toward the house thus indicated.
</p>

<p>
It is situated on the north side of Oxford Street, in a dull
but respectable thoroughfare.  I found the house shut up&mdash;no
bill at the window, and no response to my knock.  As I
was turning away, a beer-boy, collecting pewter pots at the
neighboring areas, said to me, "Do you want any one at
that house, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I heard it was to be let."
</p>

<p>
"Let!&mdash;why, the woman who kept it is dead&mdash;has been
dead these three weeks, and no one can be found to stay
there, though Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; offered ever so much.  He offered
mother, who chars for him, a pound a week just to open and
shut the windows, and she would not."
</p>

<p>
"Would not!&mdash;and why?"
</p>

<p>
"The house is haunted; and the old woman who kept it
was found dead in her bed, with her eyes wide open.  They
say the devil strangled her."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh!&mdash;you speak of Mr. J&mdash;&mdash;.  Is he the owner of the
house?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Where does he live?"
</p>

<p>
"In G&mdash;&mdash; Street, No. &mdash;."
</p>

<p>
"What is he?&mdash;in any business?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir&mdash;nothing particular; a single gentleman."
</p>

<p>
I gave the pot-boy the gratuity earned by his liberal
information, and proceeded to Mr. J&mdash;&mdash;, in G&mdash;&mdash; Street,
which was close by the street that boasted the haunted
house.  I was lucky enough to find Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; at home&mdash;an
elderly man, with intelligent countenance and prepossessing
manners.
</p>

<p>
I communicated my name and my business frankly.  I
said I heard the house was considered to be haunted&mdash;that
I had a strong desire to examine a house with so equivocal
a reputation&mdash;that I should be greatly obliged if he would
allow me to hire it, though only for a night.  I was willing
to pay for that privilege whatever he might be inclined to
ask.  "Sir," said Mr. J&mdash;&mdash;, with great courtesy, "the house
is at your service, for as short or as long a time as you
please.  Rent is out of the question&mdash;the obligation will be
on my side should you be able to discover the cause of the
strange phenomena which at present deprive it of all value.
I can not let it, for I can not even get a servant to keep it
in order or answer the door.  Unluckily the house is haunted,
if I may use that expression, not only by night, but by day;
though at night the disturbances are of a more unpleasant
and sometimes of a more alarming character.  The poor old
woman who died in it three weeks ago was a pauper whom
I took out of a workhouse, for in her childhood she had been
known to some of my family, and had once been in such
good circumstances that she had rented that house of my
uncle.  She was a woman of superior education and strong
mind, and was the only person I could ever induce to
remain in the house.  Indeed, since her death, which was
sudden, and the coroner's inquest, which gave it a notoriety in
the neighborhood, I have so despaired of finding any person
to take charge of the house, much more a tenant, that
I would willingly let it rent free for a year to any one who
would pay its rates and taxes."
</p>

<p>
"How long is it since the house acquired this sinister
character?"
</p>

<p>
"That I can scarcely tell you, but very many years since.
The old woman I spoke of said it was haunted when she
rented it between thirty and forty years ago.  The fact is,
that my life has been spent in the East Indies, and in the
civil service of the Company.  I returned to England last
year, on inheriting the fortune of an uncle, among whose
possessions was the house in question.  I found it shut up
and uninhabited.  I was told that it was haunted, that no
one would inhabit it.  I smiled at what seemed to me so idle
a story.  I spent some money in repairing it&mdash;added to its
old-fashioned furniture a few modern articles&mdash;advertised it,
and obtained a lodger for a year.  He was a colonel on
half-pay.  He came in with his family, a son and a daughter,
and four or five servants: they all left the house the next
day; and, although each of them declared that he had seen
something different from that which had scared the others,
a something still was equally terrible to all.  I really could
not in conscience sue, nor even blame, the colonel for breach
of agreement.  Then I put in the old woman I have spoken
of, and she was empowered to let the house in apartments.
I never had one lodger who stayed more than three days.  I
do not tell you their stories&mdash;to no two lodgers have there
been exactly the same phenomena repeated.  It is better that
you should judge for yourself than enter the house with an
imagination influenced by previous narratives; only be
prepared to see and to hear something or other, and take
whatever precautions you yourself please."
</p>

<p>
"Have you never had a curiosity yourself to pass a night
in that house?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I passed not a night, but three hours in broad
daylight alone in that house.  My curiosity is not satisfied,
but it is quenched.  I have no desire to renew the
experiment.  You can not complain, you see, sir, that I
am not sufficiently candid; and unless your interest be
exceedingly eager and your nerves unusually strong, I
honestly add, that I advise you not to pass a night in that
house."
</p>

<p>
"My interest is exceedingly keen," said I, "and though
only a coward will boast of his nerves in situations wholly
unfamiliar to him, yet my nerves have been seasoned in
such variety of danger that I have the right to rely on
them&mdash;even in a haunted house."
</p>

<p>
Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; said very little more; he took the keys of the
house out of his bureau, gave them to me&mdash;and, thanking
him cordially for his frankness, and his urbane concession
to my wish, I carried off my prize.
</p>

<p>
Impatient for the experiment, as soon as I reached home,
I summoned my confidential servant&mdash;a young man of gay
spirits, fearless temper, and as free from superstitious
prejudice as any one I could think of.
</p>

<p>
"F&mdash;&mdash;," said I, "you remember in Germany how disappointed
we were at not finding a ghost in that old castle,
which was said to be haunted by a headless apparition?
Well, I have heard of a house in London which, I have
reason to hope, is decidedly haunted.  I mean to sleep
there to-night.  From what I hear, there is no doubt that
something will allow itself to be seen or to be heard&mdash;something,
perhaps, excessively horrible.  Do you think, if I
take you with me, I may rely on your presence of mind,
whatever may happen?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir! pray trust me," answered F&mdash;&mdash;, grinning with
delight.
</p>

<p>
"Very well; then here are the keys of the house&mdash;this is
the address.  Go now&mdash;select for me any bedroom you please;
and since the house has not been inhabited for weeks, make
up a good fire&mdash;air the bed well&mdash;see, of course, that there
are candles as well as fuel.  Take with you my revolver
and my dagger&mdash;so much for my weapons&mdash;arm yourself
equally well; and if we are not a match for a dozen ghosts,
we shall be but a sorry couple of Englishmen."
</p>

<p>
I was engaged for the rest of the day on business so
urgent that had not leisure to think much on the nocturnal
adventure to which I had plighted my honor.  I dined
alone, and very late, and while dining, read, as is my habit.
I selected one of the volumes of Macaulay's essays.  I
thought to myself that I would take the book with me;
there was so much of healthfulness in the style, and practical
life in the subjects, that it would serve as an antidote
against the influences of superstitious fancy.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, about half-past nine, I put the book into
my pocket, and strolled leisurely toward the haunted house.
I took with me a favorite dog&mdash;an exceedingly sharp, bold,
and vigilant bull-terrier&mdash;a dog fond of prowling about
strange ghostly corners and passages at night in search of
rats&mdash;a dog of dogs for a ghost.
</p>

<p>
It was a summer night, but chilly, the sky somewhat
gloomy and overcast.  Still there was a moon&mdash;faint and
sickly, but still a moon&mdash;and, if the clouds permitted, after
midnight it would be brighter.
</p>

<p>
I reached the house, knocked, and my servant opened
with a cheerful smile.
</p>

<p>
"All right, sir, and very comfortable."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said I, rather disappointed; "have you not seen
nor heard anything remarkable?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I must own I have heard something queer."
</p>

<p>
"What?&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
"The sound of feet pattering behind me; and once or twice
small noises like whispers close at my ear&mdash;nothing more."
</p>

<p>
"You are not at all frightened?"
</p>

<p>
"I! not a bit of it, sir;" and the man's bold look reassured
me on one point&mdash;viz.: that happen what might, he would
not desert me.
</p>

<p>
We were in the hall, the street-door closed, and my
attention was now drawn to my dog.  He had at first run in
eagerly enough, but had sneaked back to the door, and was
scratching and whining to get out.  After patting him on the
head, and encouraging him gently, the dog seemed to
reconcile himself to the situation, and followed me and F&mdash;&mdash;
through the house, but keeping close at my heels instead of
hurrying inquisitively in advance, which was his usual and
normal habit in all strange places.  We first visited the
subterranean apartments, the kitchen, and other offices, and
especially the cellars, in which last there were two or three
bottles of wine still left in a bin, covered with cobwebs, and
evidently, by their appearance, undisturbed for many years.
It was clear that the ghosts were not wine-bibbers.  For the
rest we discovered nothing of interest.  There was a gloomy
little back-yard, with very high walls.  The stones of this
yard were very damp; and what with the damp, and what
with the dust and smoke-grime on the pavement, our feet
left a slight impression where we passed.  And now appeared
the first strange phenomenon witnessed by myself in this
strange abode.  I saw, just before me, the print of a foot
suddenly form itself, as it were.  I stopped, caught hold
of my servant, and pointed to it.  In advance of that
footprint as suddenly dropped another.  We both saw it.  I
advanced quickly to the place; the footprint kept advancing
before me, a small footprint&mdash;the foot of a child: the
impression was too faint thoroughly to distinguish the shape,
but it seemed to us both that it was the print of a naked
foot.
</p>

<p>
This phenomenon ceased when we arrived at the opposite
wall, nor did it repeat itself on returning.  We remounted
the stairs, and entered the rooms on the ground floor, a
dining-parlor, a small back-parlor, and a still smaller third
room that had been probably appropriated to a footman&mdash;all
still as death.  We then visited the drawing-rooms, which
seemed fresh and new.  In the front room I seated myself
in an armchair.  F&mdash;&mdash; placed on the table the candlestick
with which he had lighted us.  I told him to shut the door.
As he turned to do so, a chair opposite to me moved from
the wall quickly and noiselessly, and dropped itself about
a yard from my own chair, immediately fronting it.
</p>

<p>
"Why, this is better than the turning-tables," said I, with
a half-laugh; and as I laughed, my dog put back his head
and howled.
</p>

<p>
F&mdash;&mdash;, coming back, had not observed the movement of
the chair.  He employed himself now in stilling the dog.
I continued to gaze on the chair, and fancied I saw on it a
pale blue misty outline of a human figure, but an outline so
indistinct that I could only distrust my own vision.  The
dog was now quiet.
</p>

<p>
"Put back that chair opposite to me," said I to F&mdash;&mdash;;
"put it back to the wall."
</p>

<p>
F&mdash;&mdash; obeyed.  "Was that you, sir?" said he, turning
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"I!&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, something struck me.  I felt it sharply on the
shoulder&mdash;just here."
</p>

<p>
"No," said I.  "But we have jugglers present, and though
we may not discover their tricks, we shall catch them before
they frighten us."
</p>

<p>
We did not stay long in the drawing-rooms&mdash;in fact,
they felt so damp and so chilly that I was glad to get to the
fire upstairs.  We locked the doors of the drawing-rooms&mdash;a
precaution which, I should observe, we had taken with all
the rooms we had searched below.  The bedroom my servant
had selected for me was the best on the floor&mdash;a large one,
with two windows fronting the street.  The four-posted bed,
which took up no inconsiderable space, was opposite to the
fire, which burnt clear and bright; a door in the wall to
the left, between the bed and the window, communicated
with the room which my servant appropriated to himself.
This last was a small room with a sofa-bed, and had no
communication with the landing-place&mdash;no other door but
that which conducted to the bedroom I was to occupy.  On
either side of my fireplace was a cupboard, without locks,
flush with the wall, and covered with the same dull-brown
paper.  We examined these cupboards&mdash;only hooks to suspend
female dresses&mdash;nothing else; we sounded the walls&mdash;evidently
solid&mdash;the outer walls of the building.  Having
finished the survey of these apartments, warmed myself a
few moments, and lighted my cigar, I then, still accompanied
by F&mdash;&mdash;, went forth to complete my reconnoitre.  In the
landing-place there was another door; it was closed firmly.
"Sir," said my servant, in surprise, "I unlocked this door
with all the others when I first came; it can not have got
locked from the inside, for&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Before he had finished his sentence, the door, which
neither of us then was touching, opened quietly of itself.
We looked at each other a single instant.  The same thought
seized both&mdash;some human agency might be detected here.
I rushed in first, my servant followed.  A small blank dreary
room without furniture&mdash;a few empty boxes and hampers
in a corner&mdash;a small window&mdash;the shutters closed&mdash;not even
a fireplace&mdash;no other door but that by which we had
entered&mdash;no carpet on the floor, and the floor seemed very old,
uneven, worm-eaten, mended here and there, as was shown
by the whiter patches on the wood; but no living being, and
no visible place in which a living being could have hidden.
As we stood gazing round, the door by which we had
entered closed as quietly as it had before opened: we were
imprisoned.
</p>

<p>
For the first time I felt a creep of undefinable horror.
Not so my servant.  "Why, they don't think to trap us, sir;
I could break that trumpery door with a kick of my foot."
</p>

<p>
"Try first if it will open to your hand," said I, shaking
off the vague apprehension that had seized me, "while I
unclose the shutters and see what is without."
</p>

<p>
I unbarred the shutters&mdash;the window looked on the little
back-yard I have before described; there was no ledge
without&mdash;nothing to break the sheer descent of the wall.  No
man getting out of that window would have found any
footing till he had fallen on the stones below.
</p>

<p>
F&mdash;&mdash;, meanwhile, was vainly attempting to open the
door.  He now turned round to me and asked my permission
to use force.  And I should here state, in justice to the
servant, that, far from evincing any superstitious terrors, his
nerve, composure, and even gaiety amid circumstances so
extraordinary, compelled my admiration, and made me
congratulate myself on having secured a companion in every
way fitted to the occasion.  I willingly gave him the
permission he required.  But though he was a remarkably strong
man, his force was as idle as his milder efforts; the door
did not even shake to his stoutest kick.  Breathless and
panting, he desisted.  I then tried the door myself, equally in
vain.  As I ceased from the effort, again that creep of horror
came over me; but this time it was more cold and stubborn.
I felt as if some strange and ghastly exhalation were rising
up from the chinks of that rugged floor, and filling the
atmosphere with a venomous influence hostile to human life.
The door now very slowly and quietly opened as of its own
accord.  We precipitated ourselves into the landing-place.
We both saw a large pale light&mdash;as large as the human figure,
but shapeless and unsubstantial&mdash;move before us, and ascend
the stairs that led from the landing into the attic.  I
followed the light, and my servant followed me.  It entered to
the right of the landing, a small garret, of which the door
stood open.  I entered in the same instant.  The light then
collapsed into a small globule, exceedingly brilliant and
vivid: rested a moment on a bed in the corner, quivered, and
vanished.  We approached the bed and examined it&mdash;a half-tester,
such as is commonly found in attics devoted to servants.
On the drawers that stood near it we perceived an
old faded silk kerchief, with the needle still left in a rent half
repaired.  The kerchief was covered with dust; probably it
had belonged to the old woman who had last died in that
house, and this might have been her sleeping-room.  I had
sufficient curiosity to open the drawers: there were a few
odds and ends of female dress, and two letters tied round
with a narrow ribbon of faded yellow.  I took the liberty to
possess myself of the letters.  We found nothing else in
the room worth noticing&mdash;nor did the light reappear; but
we distinctly heard, as we turned to go, a pattering footfall
on the floor&mdash;just before us.  We went through the other
attics (in all four), the footfall still preceding us.  Nothing
to be seen&mdash;nothing but the footfall heard.  I had the
letters in my hand: just as I was descending the stairs I
distinctly felt my wrist seized, and a faint soft effort made to
draw the letters from my clasp.  I only held them the
more tightly, and the effort ceased.
</p>

<p>
We regained the bed-chamber appropriated to myself, and
I then remarked that my dog had not followed us when we
had left it.  He was thrusting himself close to the fire, and
trembling.  I was impatient to examine the letters; and
while I read them, my servant opened a little box in which
he had deposited the weapons I had ordered him to bring;
took them out, placed them on a table close at my bed-head,
and then occupied himself in soothing the dog, who,
however, seemed to heed him very little.
</p>

<p>
The letters were short&mdash;they were dated; the dates exactly
thirty-five years ago.  They were evidently from a lover
to his mistress, or a husband to some young wife.  Not only
the terms of expression, but a distinct reference to a former
voyage, indicated the writer to have been a seafarer.  The
spelling and handwriting were those of a man imperfectly
educated, but still the language itself was forcible.  In the
expressions of endearment there was a kind of rough wild
love; but here and there were dark unintelligible hints at
some secret not of love&mdash;some secret that seemed of crime.
"We ought to love each other," was one of the sentences
I remember, "for how every one else would execrate us if all
was known."  Again: "Don't let any one be in the same
room with you at night&mdash;you talk in your sleep."  And again:
"What's done can't be undone; and I tell you there's nothing
against us unless the dead could come to life."  Here there
was underlined in a better handwriting (a female's): "They
do!"  At the end of the letter latest in date the same female
hand had written these words: "Lost at sea the 4th of June,
the same day as&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I put down the letters, and began to muse over their contents.
</p>

<p>
Fearing, however, that the train of thought into which I
fell might unsteady my nerves, I fully determined to keep
my mind in a fit state to cope with whatever of marvelous
the advancing night might bring forth.  I roused myself&mdash;laid
the letters on the table&mdash;stirred up the fire, which was
still bright and cheering, and opened my volume of
Macaulay.  I read quietly enough till about half-past eleven.  I
then threw myself dressed upon the bed, and told my servant
he might retire to his own room, but must keep himself
awake.  I bade him leave open the door between the two
rooms.  Thus alone, I kept two candles burning on the table
by my bed-head.  I placed my watch beside the weapons,
and calmly resumed my Macaulay.  Opposite to me the fire
burned clear; and on the hearth-rug, seemingly asleep, lay
the dog.  In about twenty minutes I felt an exceedingly cold
air pass by my cheek, like a sudden draft.  I fancied the
door to my right, communicating with the landing-place,
must have got open; but no&mdash;it was closed.  I then turned
my glance to my left, and saw the flame of the candles
violently swayed as by a wind.  At the same moment the watch
beside the revolver softly slid from the table&mdash;softly,
softly&mdash;no visible hand&mdash;it was gone.  I sprang up, seizing the
revolver with the one hand, the dagger with the other: I was
not willing that my weapons should share the fate of the
watch.  Thus armed, I looked round the floor&mdash;no sign of
the watch.  Three slow, loud, distinct knocks were now
heard at the bed-head; my servant called out: "Is that you,
sir?"
</p>

<p>
"No; be on your guard."
</p>

<p>
The dog now roused himself and sat on his haunches, his
ears moving quickly backward and forward.  He kept his
eyes fixed on me with a look so strange that he concentred
all my attention on himself.  Slowly, he rose up, all his hair
bristling, and stood perfectly rigid, and with the same wild
stare.  I had no time, however, to examine the dog.
Presently my servant emerged from his room; and if ever I saw
horror in the human face, it was then.  I should not have
recognized him had we met in the street, so altered was
every lineament.  He passed by me quickly, saying in a
whisper that seemed scarcely to come from his lips:
"Run&mdash;run! it is after me!"  He gained the door to the landing,
pulled it open, and rushed forth.  I followed him into the
landing involuntarily, calling him to stop; but, without
heeding me, he bounded down the stairs, clinging to the balusters,
and taking several steps at a time.  I heard, where I stood,
the street-door open&mdash;heard it again clap to.  I was left
alone in the haunted house.
</p>

<p>
It was but for a moment that I remained undecided
whether or not to follow my servant; pride and curiosity
alike forbade so dastardly a flight.  I reentered my room,
closing the door after me, and proceeded cautiously into the
interior chamber.  I encountered nothing to justify my
servant's terror.  I again carefully examined the walls, to see
if there were any concealed door.  I could find no trace of
one&mdash;not even a seam in the dull-brown paper with which
the room was hung.  How, then, had the Thing, whatever
it was, which had so scared him, obtained ingress except
through my own chamber?
</p>

<p>
I returned to my room, shut and locked the door that
opened upon the interior one, and stood on the hearth,
expectant and prepared.  I now perceived that the dog had
slunk into an angle of the wall, and was pressing himself
close against it, as if literally striving to force his way into
it.  I approached the animal and spoke to it; the poor brute
was evidently beside itself with terror.  It showed all its
teeth, the slaver dropping from its jaws, and would certainly
have bitten me if I had touched it.  It did not seem to
recognize me.  Whoever has seen at the Zoological Gardens a
rabbit, fascinated by a serpent, cowering in a corner, may
form some idea of the anguish which the dog exhibited.
Finding all efforts to soothe the animal in vain, and fearing
that his bite might be as venomous in that state as in the
madness of hydrophobia, I left him alone, placed my weapons
on the table beside the fire, seated myself, and recommenced
my Macaulay.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, in order not to appear seeking credit for a courage,
or rather a coolness, which the reader may conceive I
exaggerate, I may be pardoned if I pause to indulge in one
or two egotistical remarks.
</p>

<p>
As I hold presence of mind, or what is called courage, to
be precisely proportioned to familiarity with the circumstances
that lead to it, so I should say that I had been long
sufficiently familiar with all experiments that appertain to
the Marvelous.  I had witnessed many very extraordinary
phenomena in various parts of the world&mdash;phenomena that
would be either totally disbelieved if I stated them, or
ascribed to supernatural agencies.  Now, my theory is that
the Supernatural is the Impossible, and that what is called
supernatural is only a something in the laws of nature of
which we have been hitherto ignorant.  Therefore, if a ghost
rise before me, I have not the right to say, "So, then, the
supernatural is possible," but rather, "So, then, the apparition
of a ghost is, contrary to received opinion, within the
laws of nature&mdash;i.e., not supernatural."
</p>

<p>
Now, in all that I had hitherto witnessed, and indeed in
all the wonders which the amateurs of mystery in our age
record as facts, a material living agency is always required.
On the Continent you will find still magicians who assert
that they can raise spirits.  Assume for the moment that
they assert truly, still the living material form of the
magician is present; and he is the material agency by which, from
some constitutional peculiarities, certain strange phenomena
are represented to your natural senses.
</p>

<p>
Accept, again, as truthful, the tales of Spirit Manifestation
in America&mdash;musical or other sounds&mdash;writings on paper,
produced by no discernible hand&mdash;articles of furniture moved
without apparent human agency&mdash;or the actual sight and
touch of hands, to which no bodies seem to belong&mdash;still
there must be found the Medium, or living being with
constitutional peculiarities capable of obtaining these signs.
In fine, in all such marvels, supposing even that there is no
imposture, there must be a human being like ourselves by
whom, or through whom, the effects presented to human beings
are produced.  It is so with the now familiar phenomena
of mesmerism or electro-biology; the mind of the person
operated on is affected through a material living agent.
Nor, supposing it true that a mesmerized patient can respond
to the will or passes of a mesmerizer a hundred miles distant,
is the response less occasioned by a material being; it may
be through a material fluid&mdash;call it Electric, call it Odic, call
it what you will&mdash;which has the power of traversing space
and passing obstacles that the material effect is communicated
from one to the other.  Hence all that I had hitherto
witnessed, or expected to witness, in this strange house, I
believed to be occasioned through some agency or medium
as mortal as myself; and this idea necessarily prevented the
awe with which those who regard as supernatural things
that are not within the ordinary operations of nature might
have been impressed by the adventures of that memorable
night.
</p>

<p>
As, then, it was my conjecture that all that was presented,
or would be presented, to my senses must originate
in some human being gifted by constitution with the power
so to present them, and having some motive so to do, I felt
an interest in my theory which, in its way, was rather
philosophical than superstitious.  And I can sincerely say that
I was in as tranquil a temper for observation as any practical
experimentalist could be in awaiting the effects of some
rare, though perhaps perilous, chemical combination.  Of
course, the more I kept my mind detached from fancy, the
more the temper fitted for observation would be obtained;
and I therefore riveted eye and thought on the strong
daylight sense in the page of my Macaulay.
</p>

<p>
I now became aware that something interposed between
the page and the light&mdash;the page was overshadowed: I
looked up, and I saw what I shall find it very difficult,
perhaps impossible, to describe.
</p>

<p>
It was a darkness shaping itself forth from the air in very
undefined outline.  I can not say it was of a human form,
and yet it had more resemblance to a human form, or rather
shadow, than to anything else.  As it stood, wholly apart
and distinct from the air and the light around it, its
dimensions seemed gigantic, the summit nearly touching the
ceiling.  While I gazed, a feeling of intense cold seized me.  An
iceberg before me could not more have chilled me; nor
could the cold of an iceberg have been more purely physical.
I feel convinced that it was not the cold caused by fear.  As
I continued to gaze, I thought&mdash;but this I can not say with
precision&mdash;that I distinguished two eyes looking down on
me from the height.  One moment I fancied that I distinguished
them clearly, the next they seemed gone; but still
two rays of a pale-blue light frequently shot through the
darkness, as from the height on which I half believed, half
doubted, that I had encountered the eyes.
</p>

<p>
I strove to speak&mdash;my voice utterly failed me; I could
only think to myself: "Is this fear? it is not fear!"  I
strove to rise&mdash;in vain; I felt as if weighed down by an
irresistible force.  Indeed, my impression was that of an
immense and overwhelming power opposed to my volition&mdash;that
sense of utter inadequacy to cope with a force beyond
man's, which one may feel physically in a storm at sea, in
a conflagration, or when confronting some terrible wild beast,
or rather, perhaps, the shark of the ocean, I felt morally.
Opposed to my will was another will, as far superior to its
strength as storm, fire, and shark are superior in material
force to the force of man.
</p>

<p>
And now, as this impression grew on me&mdash;now came, at
last, horror&mdash;horror to a degree that no words can convey.
Still I retained pride, if not courage; and in my own mind
I said: "This is horror, but it is not fear; unless I fear I
can not be harmed; my reason rejects this thing; it is an
illusion&mdash;I do not fear."  With a violent effort I succeeded
at last in stretching out my hand toward the weapon on the
table: as I did so, on the arm and shoulder I received a
strange shock, and my arm fell to my side powerless.  And
now, to add to my horror, the light began slowly to wane
from the candles&mdash;they were not, as it were, extinguished,
but their flame seemed very gradually withdrawn: it was
the same with the fire&mdash;the light was extracted from the
fuel; in a few minutes the room was in utter darkness.  The
dread that came over me, to be thus in the dark with that
dark Thing, whose power was so intensely felt, brought
a reaction of nerve.  In fact, terror had reached that climax,
that either my senses must have deserted me, or I must have
burst through the spell.  I did burst through it.  I found
voice, though the voice was a shriek.  I remembered that I
broke forth with words like these: "I do not fear, my soul
does not fear;" and at the same time I found strength to
rise.  Still in that profound gloom I rushed to one of the
windows&mdash;tore aside the curtain&mdash;flung open the shutters;
my first thought was&mdash;Light.  And when I saw the moon
high, clear, and calm, I felt a joy that almost compensated
for the previous terror.  There was the moon, there was also
the light from the gas-lamps in the deserted slumberous
street.  I turned to look back into the room; the moon
penetrated its shadow very palely and partially&mdash;but still there
was light.  The dark Thing, whatever it might be, was
gone&mdash;except that I could yet see a dim shadow, which seemed the
shadow of that shade, against the opposite wall.
</p>

<p>
My eye now rested on the table, and from under the table
(which was without cloth or cover&mdash;an old mahogany round
table) there rose a hand, visible as far as the wrist.  It was
a hand, seemingly, as much of flesh and blood as my own,
but the hand of an aged person&mdash;lean, wrinkled, small
too&mdash;a woman's hand.  That hand very softly closed on the two
letters that lay on the table: hand and letters both vanished.
There then came the same three loud measured knocks I
had heard at the bed-head before this extraordinary drama
had commenced.
</p>

<p>
As those sounds slowly ceased, I felt the whole room
vibrate sensibly; and at the far end there rose, as from the
floor, sparks or globules like bubbles of light, many
colored&mdash;green, yellow, fire-red, azure.  Up and down, to and fro,
hither, thither, as tiny Will-o'-the-Wisps, the sparks moved,
slow or swift, each at its own caprice.  A chair (as in the
drawing-room below) was now advanced from the wall without
apparent agency, and placed at the opposite side of the
table.  Suddenly, as forth from the chair, there grew a
shape&mdash;a woman's shape.  It was distinct as a shape of
life&mdash;ghastly as a shape of death.  The face was that of youth,
with a strange mournful beauty; the throat and shoulders
were bare, the rest of the form in a loose robe of cloudy
white.  It began sleeking its long yellow hair, which fell over
its shoulders; its eyes were not turned toward me, but to the
door; it seemed listening, watching, waiting.  The shadow of
the shade in the background grew darker; and again I
thought I beheld the eyes gleaming out from the summit of
the shadow&mdash;eyes fixed upon that shape.
</p>

<p>
As if from the door, though it did not open, there grew
out another shape, equally distinct, equally ghastly&mdash;a man's
shape&mdash;a young man's.  It was in the dress of the last century,
or rather in a likeness of such dress (for both the male
shape and the female, though defined, were evidently
unsubstantial, impalpable&mdash;simulacra&mdash;phantasms); and there was
something incongruous, grotesque, yet fearful, in the contrast
between the elaborate finery, the courtly precision of
that old-fashioned garb, with its ruffles and lace and buckles,
and the corpse-like stillness of the flitting wearer.  Just as
the male shape approached the female, the dark Shadow
started from the wall, all three for a moment wrapped in
darkness.  When the pale light returned, the two phantoms
were as if in the grasp of the Shadow that towered between
them; and there was a blood-stain on the breast of the
female; and the phantom male was leaning on its phantom
sword, and blood seemed trickling fast from the ruffles, from
the lace; and the darkness of the intermediate Shadow
swallowed them up&mdash;they were gone.  And again the bubbles of
light shot, and sailed, and undulated, growing thicker and
thicker and more wildly confused in their movements.
</p>

<p>
The closet door to the right of the fireplace now opened,
and from the aperture there came the form of an aged
woman.  In her hand she held letters&mdash;the very letters over
which I had seen the Hand close; and behind her I heard
a footstep.  She turned round as if to listen, and then she
opened the letters and seemed to read; and over her shoulder
I saw a livid face, the face as of a man long drowned&mdash;bloated,
bleached&mdash;seaweed tangled in its dripping hair; and at her
feet lay a form as of a corpse, and beside the corpse there
cowered a child, a miserable squalid child, with famine in
its cheeks and fear in its eyes.  And as I looked in the old
woman's face, the wrinkles and lines vanished, and it became
a face of youth&mdash;hard-eyed, stony, but still youth; and
the Shadow darted forth, and darkened over these phantoms
as it had darkened over the last.
</p>

<p>
Nothing now was left but the Shadow, and on that my
eyes were intently fixed, till again eyes grew out of the
Shadow&mdash;malignant, serpent eyes.  And the bubbles of light
again rose and fell, and in their disordered, irregular,
turbulent maze, mingled with the wan moonlight.  And now
from these globules themselves, as from the shell of an
egg, monstrous things burst out; the air grew filled with
them; larvæ so bloodless and so hideous that I can in no
way describe them except to remind the reader of the swarming
life which the solar microscope brings before his eyes
in a drop of water&mdash;things transparent, supple, agile, chasing
each other, devouring each other&mdash;forms like naught ever
beheld by the naked eye.  As the shapes were without
symmetry, so their movements were without order.  In their
very vagrancies there was no sport; they came round me
and round, thicker and faster and swifter, swarming over
my head, crawling over my right arm, which was outstretched
in involuntary command against all evil beings.
Sometimes I felt myself touched, but not by them; invisible
hands touched me.  Once I felt the clutch as of cold soft
fingers at my throat.  I was still equally conscious that if
I gave way to fear I should be in bodily peril; and I
concentred all my faculties in the single focus of resisting,
stubborn will.  And I turned my sight from the Shadow&mdash;above
all, from those strange serpent eyes&mdash;eyes that had
now become distinctly visible.  For there, though in naught
else around me, I was aware that there was a WILL, and
a will of intense, creative, working evil, which might crush
down my own.
</p>

<p>
The pale atmosphere in the room began now to redden as
if in the air of some near conflagration.  The larvæ grew
lurid as things that live in fire.  Again the room vibrated;
again were heard the three measured knocks; and again all
things were swallowed up in the darkness of the dark
Shadow, as if out of that darkness all had come, into that
darkness all returned.
</p>

<p>
As the gloom receded, the Shadow was wholly gone.
Slowly, as it had been withdrawn, the flame grew again into
the candles on the table, again into the fuel in the grate.  The
whole room came once more calmly, healthfully into sight.
</p>

<p>
The two doors were still closed, the door communicating
with the servant's room still locked.  In the corner of the
wall, into which he had so convulsively niched himself, lay
the dog.  I called to him&mdash;no movement; I approached&mdash;the
animal was dead; his eyes protruded; his tongue out of his
mouth; the froth gathered round his jaws.  I took him in
my arms; I brought him to the fire; I felt acute grief for
the loss of my poor favorite&mdash;acute self-reproach; I accused
myself of his death; I imagined he had died of fright.  But
what was my surprise on finding that his neck was actually
broken.  Had this been done in the dark?&mdash;must it not have
been by a hand human as mine?&mdash;must there not have been
a human agency all the while in that room?  Good cause
to suspect it.  I can not tell.  I can not do more than state
the fact fairly; the reader may draw his own inference.
</p>

<p>
Another surprising circumstance&mdash;my watch was restored
to the table from which it had been so mysteriously
withdrawn; but it had stopped at the very moment it was so
withdrawn; nor, despite all the skill of the watchmaker,
has it ever gone since&mdash;that is, it will go in a strange erratic
way for a few hours, and then come to a dead stop&mdash;it is
worthless.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Nothing more chanced for the rest of the night.  Nor,
indeed, had I long to wait before the dawn broke.  Nor till
it was broad daylight did I quit the haunted house.  Before
I did so, I revisited the little blind room in which my
servant and myself had been for a time imprisoned.  I had a
strong impression&mdash;for which I could not account&mdash;that from
that room had originated the mechanism of the phenomena&mdash;if
I may use the term&mdash;which had been experienced in my
chamber.  And though I entered it now in the clear day,
with the sun peering through the filmy window, I still felt,
as I stood on its floors, the creep of the horror which I had
first there experienced the night before, and which had been
so aggravated by what had passed in my own chamber.  I
could not, indeed, bear to stay more than half a minute
within those walls.  I descended the stairs, and again I
heard the footfall before me; and when I opened the street
door, I thought I could distinguish a very low laugh.  I
gained my own house, expecting to find my runaway servant
there.  But he had not presented himself, nor did I
hear more of him for three days, when I received a letter
from him, dated from Liverpool to this effect:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Honored Sir&mdash;I humbly entreat your pardon, though
I can scarcely hope that you will think that I deserve it,
unless&mdash;which Heaven forbid!&mdash;you saw what I did.  I feel
that it will be years before I can recover myself; and as to
being fit for service, it is out of the question.  I am
therefore going to my brother-in-law at Melbourne.  The ship
sails to-morrow.  Perhaps the long voyage may set me up.
I do nothing now but start and tremble, and fancy It is
behind me.  I humbly beg you, honored sir, to order my clothes,
and whatever wages are due to me, to be sent to my mother's,
at Walworth&mdash;John knows her address."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The letter ended with additional apologies, somewhat
incoherent, and explanatory details as to effects that had been
under the writer's charge.
</p>

<p>
This flight may perhaps warrant a suspicion that the
man wished to go to Australia, and had been somehow or
other fraudulently mixed up with the events of the night.
I say nothing in refutation of that conjecture; rather, I
suggest it as one that would seem to many persons the most
probable solution of improbable occurrences.  My belief in
my own theory remained unshaken.  I returned in the evening
to the house, to bring away in a hack cab the things I
had left there, with my poor dog's body.  In this task I was
not disturbed, nor did any incident worth note befall me,
except that still, on ascending and descending the stairs, I
heard the same footfall in advance.  On leaving the house,
I went to Mr. J&mdash;&mdash;'s.  He was at home.  I returned him the
keys, told him that my curiosity was sufficiently gratified,
and was about to relate quickly what had passed, when he
stopped me, and said, though with much politeness, that he
had no longer any interest in a mystery which none had
ever solved.
</p>

<p>
I determined at least to tell him of the two letters I had
read, as well as of the extraordinary manner in which they
had disappeared, and I then inquired if he thought they
had been addressed to the woman who had died in the house,
and if there were anything in her early history which could
possibly confirm the dark suspicions to which the letters
gave rise.  Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; seemed startled, and, after musing
a few moments, answered: "I am but little acquainted with
the woman's earlier history, except, as I before told you,
that her family were known to mine.  But you revive some
vague reminiscences to her prejudice.  I will make inquiries,
and inform you of their result.  Still, even if we could admit
the popular superstition that a person who had been either
the perpetrator or the victim of dark crimes in life could
revisit, as a restless spirit, the scene in which those crimes
had been committed, I should observe that the house was
infested by strange sights and sounds before the old woman
died&mdash;you smile&mdash;what would you say?"
</p>

<p>
"I would say this, that I am convinced, if we could get
to the bottom of these mysteries, we should find a living
human agency."
</p>

<p>
"What!  you believe it is all an imposture? for what
object?"
</p>

<p>
"Not an imposture in the ordinary sense of the word.  If
suddenly I were to sink into a deep sleep, from which you
could not awake me, but in that sleep could answer
questions with an accuracy which I could not pretend to when
awake&mdash;tell you what money you had in your pocket&mdash;nay,
describe your very thoughts&mdash;it is not necessarily an
imposture, any more than it is necessarily supernatural.  I
should be, unconsciously to myself, under a mesmeric
influence, conveyed to me from a distance by a human being
who had acquired power over me by previous rapport."
</p>

<p>
"But if a mesmerizer could so affect another living being,
can you suppose that a mesmerizer could also affect
inanimate objects; move chairs&mdash;open and shut doors?"
</p>

<p>
"Or impress our senses with the belief in such effects&mdash;we
never having been <i>en rapport</i> with the person acting on
us?  No.  What is commonly called mesmerism could not
do this; but there may be a power akin to mesmerism and
superior to it&mdash;the power that in the old days was called
Magic.  That such a power may extend to all inanimate
objects of matter, I do not say; but if so, it would not be
against nature&mdash;it would only be a rare power in nature
which might be given to constitutions with certain peculiarities,
and cultivated by practise to an extraordinary degree.
That such a power might extend over the dead&mdash;that is,
over certain thoughts and memories that the dead may still
retain&mdash;and compel, not that which ought properly to be
called the Soul, and which is far beyond human reach, but
rather a phantom of what has been most earth-stained on
earth to make itself apparent to our senses&mdash;is a very ancient
though obsolete theory, upon which I will hazard no opinion.
But I do not conceive the power would be supernatural.
Let me illustrate what I mean from an experiment which
Paracelsus describes as not difficult, and which the author
of the 'Curiosities of Literature' cites as credible: A flower
perishes; you burn it.  Whatever were the elements of that
flower while it lived are gone, dispersed, you know not
whither; you can never discover nor re-collect them.  But
you can, by chemistry, out of the burned dust of that flower,
raise a spectrum of the flower, just as it seemed in life.  It
may be the same with the human being.  The soul has as
much escaped you as the essence or elements of the flower.
Still you may make a spectrum of it.  And this phantom,
though in the popular superstition it is held to be the soul
of the departed, must not be confounded with the true soul;
it is but the <i>eidolon</i> of the dead form.  Hence, like the best
attested stories of ghosts or spirits, the thing that most
strikes us is the absence of what we hold to be the soul; that
is, of superior emancipated intelligence.  These apparitions
come for little or no object&mdash;they seldom speak when they
do come; if they speak, they utter no ideas above those of
an ordinary person on earth.  American spirit-seers have
published volumes of communications, in prose and verse,
which they assert to be given in the names of the most
illustrious dead&mdash;Shakespeare, Bacon&mdash;heaven knows whom.
Those communications, taking the best, are certainly not a
whit of higher order than would be communications from
living persons of fair talent and education; they are
wondrously inferior to what Bacon, Shakespeare, and Plato said
and wrote when on earth.  Nor, what is more noticeable, do
they ever contain an idea that was not on the earth before.
Wonderful, therefore, as such phenomena may be (granting
them to be truthful), I see much that philosophy may
question, nothing that it is incumbent on philosophy to
deny&mdash;viz., nothing supernatural.  They are but ideas conveyed
somehow or other (we have not yet discovered the means)
from one mortal brain to another.  Whether, in so doing,
tables walk of their own accord, or fiendlike shapes appear
in a magic circle, or bodyless hands rise and remove material
objects, or a Thing of Darkness, such as presented itself
to me, freeze our blood&mdash;still am I persuaded that these are
but agencies conveyed, as by electric wires, to my own brain
from the brain of another.  In some constitutions there is
a natural chemistry, and those constitutions may produce
chemic wonders&mdash;in others a natural fluid, call it electricity,
and these may produce electric wonders.  But the wonders
differ from Natural Science in this&mdash;they are alike objectless,
purposeless, puerile, frivolous.  They lead on to no grand
results; and therefore the world does not heed, and true
sages have not cultivated them.  But sure I am, that of all
I saw or heard, a man, human as myself, was the remote
originator; and I believe unconsciously to himself as to the
exact effects produced, for this reason: no two persons, you
say, have ever told you that they experienced exactly the
same thing.  Well, observe, no two persons ever experience
exactly the same dream.  If this were an ordinary imposture,
the machinery would be arranged for results that would but
little vary; if it were a supernatural agency permitted by
the Almighty, it would surely be for some definite end.
These phenomena belong to neither class; my persuasion
is that they originate in some brain now far distant; that
that brain had no distinct volition in anything that occurred;
that what does occur reflects but its devious, motley,
ever-shifting, half-formed thoughts; in short, that it has been but
the dreams of such a brain put into action and invested with
a semi-substance.  That this brain is of immense power,
that it can set matter into movement, that it is malignant
and destructive, I believe; some material force must have
killed my dog; the same force might, for aught I know, have
sufficed to kill myself, had I been as subjugated by terror as
the dog&mdash;had my intellect or my spirit given me no
countervailing resistance in my will."
</p>

<p>
"It killed your dog! that is fearful! indeed it is strange
that no animal can be induced to stay in that house; not
even a cat.  Rats and mice are never found in it."
</p>

<p>
"The instincts of the brute creation detect influences
deadly to their existence.  Man's reason has a sense less
subtle, because it has a resisting power more supreme.  But
enough; do you comprehend my theory?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, though imperfectly&mdash;and I accept any crotchet
(pardon the word), however odd, rather than embrace at
once the notion of ghosts and hobgoblins we imbibed in our
nurseries.  Still, to my unfortunate house the evil is the
same.  What on earth can I do with the house?"
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you what I would do.  I am convinced from
my own internal feelings that the small unfurnished room
at right angles to the door of the bedroom which I occupied
forms a starting-point or receptacle for the influences
which haunt the house; and I strongly advise you to have
the walls opened, the floor removed&mdash;nay, the whole room
pulled down.  I observe that it is detached from the body
of the house, built over the small back-yard, and could be
removed without injury to the rest of the building."
</p>

<p>
"And you think, if I did that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You would cut off the telegraph wires.  Try it.  I am
so persuaded that I am right that I will pay half the
expense if you will allow me to direct the operations."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, I am well able to afford the cost; for the rest, allow
me to write to you."
</p>

<p>
About ten days after I received a letter from Mr. J&mdash;&mdash;,
telling me that he had visited the house since I had seen
him; that he had found the two letters I had described,
replaced in the drawer from which I had taken them; that
he had read them with misgivings like my own; that he
had instituted a cautious inquiry about the woman to whom
I rightly conjectured they had been written.  It seemed that
thirty-six years ago (a year before the date of the letters)
she had married, against the wish of her relations, an American
of very suspicious character; in fact, he was generally
believed to have been a pirate.  She herself was the daughter
of very respectable tradespeople, and had served in the
capacity of a nursery governess before her marriage.  She
had a brother, a widower, who was considered wealthy,
and who had one child of about six years old.  A month
after the marriage, the body of this brother was found in
the Thames, near London Bridge; there seemed some marks
of violence about his throat, but they were not deemed
sufficient to warrant the inquest in any other verdict than that
of "found drowned."
</p>

<p>
The American and his wife took charge of the little boy,
the deceased brother having by his will left his sister the
guardianship of his only child&mdash;and in event of the child's
death, the sister inherited.  The child died about six months
afterward&mdash;it was supposed to have been neglected and
ill-treated.  The neighbors deposed to having heard it shriek at
night.  The surgeon who had examined it after death said
that it was emaciated as if from want of nourishment, and
the body was covered with livid bruises.  It seemed that
one winter night the child had sought to escape&mdash;crept out
into the back-yard&mdash;tried to scale the wall&mdash;fallen back
exhausted, and been found at morning on the stones in a dying
state.  But though there was some evidence of cruelty, there
was none of murder; and the aunt and her husband had
sought to palliate cruelty by alleging the exceeding
stubbornness and perversity of the child, who was declared to
be half-witted.  Be that as it may, at the orphan's death the
aunt inherited her brother's fortune.  Before the first wedded
year was out, the American quitted England abruptly, and
never returned to it.  He obtained a cruising vessel, which
was lost in the Atlantic two years afterward.  The widow
was left in affluence; but reverses of various kinds had
befallen her: a bank broke&mdash;an investment failed&mdash;she went
into a small business and became insolvent&mdash;then she
entered into service, sinking lower and lower, from housekeeper
down to maid-of-all-work&mdash;never long retaining a place,
though nothing decided against her character was ever
alleged.  She was considered sober, honest, and peculiarly
quiet in her ways; still nothing prospered with her.  And so
she had dropped into the workhouse, from which Mr. J&mdash;&mdash;
had taken her, to be placed in charge of the very house which
she had rented as mistress in the first year of her wedded
life.
</p>

<p>
Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; added that he had passed an hour alone in the
unfurnished room which I had urged him to destroy, and
that his impressions of dread while there were so great,
though he had neither heard nor seen anything, that he was
eager to have the walls bared and the floors removed as I
had suggested.  He had engaged persons for the work, and
would commence any day I would name.
</p>

<p>
The day was accordingly fixed.  I repaired to the haunted
house&mdash;we went into the blind dreary room, took up the
skirting, and then the floors.  Under the rafters, covered
with rubbish, was found a trap-door, quite large enough to
admit a man.  It was closely nailed down, with clamps and
rivets of iron.  On removing these we descended into a room
below, the existence of which had never been suspected.  In
this room there had been a window and a flue, but they had
been bricked over, evidently for many years.  By the help
of candles we examined this place; it still retained some
moldering furniture&mdash;three chairs, an oak settle, a table&mdash;all
of the fashion of about eighty years ago.  There was a
chest of drawers against the wall, in which we found,
half-rotted away, old-fashioned articles of a man's dress, such
as might have been worn eighty or a hundred years ago by
a gentleman of some rank&mdash;costly steel buckles and buttons,
like those yet worn in court-dresses, a handsome court sword&mdash;in
a waistcoat which had once been rich with gold-lace, but
which was now blackened and foul with damp, we found five
guineas, a few silver coins, and an ivory ticket, probably
for some place of entertainment long since passed away.
But our main discovery was in a kind of iron safe fixed to
the wall, the lock of which it cost us much trouble to get
picked.
</p>

<p>
In this safe were three shelves, and two small drawers.
Ranged on the shelves were several small bottles of crystal,
hermetically stoppered.  They contained colorless volatile
essences, of the nature of which I shall only say that they were
not poisonous&mdash;phosphor and ammonia entered into some
of them.  There were also some very curious glass tubes,
and a small pointed rod of iron, with a large lump of
rock-crystal, and another of amber&mdash;also a loadstone of great
power.
</p>

<p>
In one of the drawers we found a miniature portrait set
in gold, and retaining the freshness of its colors most
remarkably, considering the length of time it had probably
been there.  The portrait was that of a man who might be
somewhat advanced in middle life, perhaps forty-seven or
forty-eight.
</p>

<p>
It was a remarkable face&mdash;a most impressive face.  If
you could fancy some mighty serpent transformed into man,
preserving in the human lineaments the old serpent type,
you would have a better idea of that countenance than long
descriptions can convey: the width and flatness of
frontal&mdash;the tapering elegance of contour disguising the strength
of the deadly jaw&mdash;the long, large, terrible eye, glittering
and green as the emerald&mdash;and withal a certain ruthless
calm, as if from the consciousness of an immense power.
</p>

<p>
Mechanically I turned round the miniature to examine
the back of it, and on the back was engraved a pentacle;
in the middle of the pentacle a ladder, and the third step of
the ladder was formed by the date 1765.  Examining still
more minutely, I detected a spring; this, on being pressed,
opened the back of the miniature as a lid.  Withinside the
lid was engraved, "Marianna to thee&mdash;Be faithful in life
and in death to &mdash;&mdash;."  Here follows a name that I will
not mention, but it was not unfamiliar to me.  I had heard
it spoken of by old men in my childhood as the name borne
by a dazzling charlatan who had made a great sensation in
London for a year or so, and had fled the country on the
charge of a double murder within his own house&mdash;that of
his mistress and his rival.  I said nothing of this to
Mr. J&mdash;&mdash;, to whom reluctantly I resigned the miniature.
</p>

<p>
We had found no difficulty in opening the first drawer
within the iron safe; we found great difficulty in opening
the second: it was not locked, but it resisted all efforts, till
we inserted in the chinks the edge of a chisel.  When we
had thus drawn it forth, we found a very singular apparatus
in the nicest order.  Upon a small thin book, or rather
tablet, was placed a saucer of crystal; this saucer was filled
with a clear liquid&mdash;on that liquid floated a kind of compass,
with a needle shifting rapidly round; but instead of the
usual points of a compass were seven strange characters,
not very unlike those used by astrologers to denote the
planets.  A peculiar but not strong nor displeasing odor
came from this drawer, which was lined with a wood that
we afterward discovered to be hazel.  Whatever the cause
of this odor, it produced a material effect on the nerves.
We all felt it, even the two workmen who were in the room&mdash;a
creeping, tingling sensation from the tips of the fingers
to the roots of the hair.  Impatient to examine the tablet,
I removed the saucer.  As I did so the needle of the
compass went round and round with exceeding swiftness, and
I felt a shock that ran through my whole frame, so that I
dropped the saucer on the floor.  The liquid was spilled&mdash;the
saucer was broken&mdash;the compass rolled to the end of
the room&mdash;and at that instant the walls shook to and fro,
as if a giant had swayed and rocked them.
</p>

<p>
The two workmen were so frightened that they ran up
the ladder by which we had descended from the trap-door;
but seeing that nothing more happened, they were easily
induced to return.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile I had opened the tablet: it was bound in
plain red leather, with a silver clasp; it contained but one
sheet of thick vellum, and on that sheet were inscribed,
within a double pentacle, words in old monkish Latin, which
are literally to be translated thus: "On all that it can reach
within these walls&mdash;sentient or inanimate, living or dead&mdash;as
moves the needle, so work my will!  Accursed be the
house, and restless be the dwellers therein."
</p>

<p>
We found no more.  Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; burned the tablet and
its anathema.  He razed to the foundations the part of the
building containing the secret room with the chamber over
it.  He had then the courage to inhabit the house himself
for a month, and a quieter, better-conditioned house could
not be found in all London.  Subsequently he let it to
advantage, and his tenant has made no complaints.

THE DREAM-WOMAN
</p>

<p class="t3">
By WILKIE COLLINS
</p>

<p>
Some years ago there lived in the suburbs of a
large seaport town on the west coast of England
a man in humble circumstances, by name Isaac
Scatchard.  His means of subsistence were derived
from any employment that he could get as an ostler, and
occasionally when times went well with him, from temporary
engagements in service as stable-helper in private houses.
Though a faithful, steady, and honest man, he got on badly
in his calling.  His ill-luck was proverbial among his
neighbors.  He was always missing good opportunities by no
fault of his own, and always living longest in service with
amiable people who were not punctual payers of wages.
"Unlucky Isaac" was his nickname in his own neighborhood,
and no one could say that he did not richly deserve it.
</p>

<p>
With far more than one man's fair share of adversity to
endure, Isaac had but one consolation to support him, and
that was of the dreariest and most negative kind.  He had
no wife and children to increase his anxieties and add to
the bitterness of his various failures in life.  It might have
been from mere insensibility, or it might have been from
generous unwillingness to involve another in his own
unlucky destiny; but the fact undoubtedly was, that he had
arrived at the middle term of life without marrying, and,
what is much more remarkable, without once exposing himself,
from eighteen to eight-and-thirty, to the genial imputation
of ever having had a sweetheart.
</p>

<p>
When he was out of service he lived alone with his
widowed mother.  Mrs. Scatchard was a woman above the
average in her lowly station as to capacity and manners.  She
had seen better days, as the phrase is, but she never
referred to them in the presence of curious visitors; and,
though perfectly polite to every one who approached her,
never cultivated any intimacies among her neighbors.  She
contrived to provide hardly enough for her simple wants
by doing rough work for the tailors, and always managed
to keep a decent home for her son to return to whenever
his ill-luck drove him out helpless into the world.
</p>

<p>
One bleak autumn, when Isaac was getting on fast toward
forty, and when he was, as usual, out of place through no
fault of his own, he set forth from his mother's cottage on a
long walk inland to a gentleman's seat, where he had heard
that a stable-helper was required.
</p>

<p>
It wanted then but two days of his birthday; and
Mrs. Scatchard, with her usual fondness, made him promise,
before he started, that he would be back in time to keep that
anniversary with her, in as festive a way as their poor means
would allow.  It was easy for him to comply with this
request, even supposing he slept a night each way on the
road.
</p>

<p>
He was to start from home on Monday morning, and,
whether he got the new place or not, he was to be back for
his birthday dinner on Wednesday at two o'clock.
</p>

<p>
Arriving at his destination too late on the Monday night
to make application for the stable-helper's place, he slept at
the village inn, and in good time on the Tuesday morning
presented himself at the gentleman's house to fill the vacant
situation.  Here again his ill-luck pursued him as inexorably
as ever.  The excellent written testimonials to his character
which he was able to procure availed him nothing; his long
walk had been taken in vain: only the day before the
stable-helper's place had been given to another man.
</p>

<p>
Isaac accepted this new disappointment resignedly and
as a matter of course.  Naturally slow in capacity, he had
the bluntness of sensibility and phlegmatic patience of
disposition which frequently distinguish men with sluggishly
working mental powers.  He thanked the gentleman's steward
with his usual quiet civility for granting him an interview,
and took his departure with no appearance of unusual
depression in his face or manner.
</p>

<p>
Before starting on his homeward walk, he made some
inquiries at the inn, and ascertained that he might save a
few miles on his return by following a new road.  Furnished
with full instructions, several times repeated, as to the
various turnings he was to take, he set forth on his homeward
journey, and walked on all day with only one stoppage for
bread and cheese.  Just as it was getting toward dark, the
rain came on and the wind began to rise, and he found
himself, to make matters worse, in a part of the country with
which he was entirely unacquainted, though he knew
himself to be some fifteen miles from home.  The first house
he found to inquire at was a lonely roadside inn, standing
on the outskirts of a thick wood.  Solitary as the place
looked, it was welcome to a lost man who was also hungry,
thirsty, foot-sore, and wet.  The landlord was civil, and
respectable-looking, and the price he asked for a bed was
reasonable enough.  Isaac therefore decided on stopping
comfortably at the inn for that night.
</p>

<p>
He was constitutionally a temperate man.  His supper
consisted of two rashers of bacon, a slice of home-made
bread, and a pint of ale.  He did not go to bed immediately
after this moderate meal, but sat up with the landlord, talking
about his bad prospects and his long run of ill-luck, and
diverging from these topics to the subject of horse-flesh and
racing.  Nothing was said either by himself, his host, or the
few laborers who strayed into the tap-room, which could,
in the slightest degree, excite the very small and very dull
imaginative faculty which Isaac Scatchard possessed.
</p>

<p>
At a little after eleven the house was closed.  Isaac went
round with the landlord and held the candle while the doors
and lower windows were being secured.  He noticed with
surprise the strength of the bolts and bars, and iron-sheathed
shutters.
</p>

<p>
"You see we are rather lonely here," said the landlord.
"We never have had any attempts made to break in yet, but
it's always as well to be on the safe side.  When nobody is
sleeping here, I am the only man in the house.  My wife and
daughter are timid, and the servant-girl takes after her
missuses.  Another glass of ale before you turn in?  No!  Well,
how such a sober man as you come to be out of a place is
more than I can make out, for one.  Here's where you're to
sleep.  You're our only lodger to-night, and I think you'll
say my missus has done her best to make you comfortable.
You're quite sure you won't have another glass of ale?
Very well.  Good-night."
</p>

<p>
It was half-past eleven by the clock in the passage as
they went upstairs to the bedroom, the window of which
looked on to the wood at the back of the house.
</p>

<p>
Isaac locked the door, set his candle on the chest of
drawers, and wearily got ready for bed.  The bleak autumn
wind was still blowing, and the solemn, monotonous, surging
moan of it in the wood was dreary and awful to hear
through the night-silence.  Isaac felt strangely wakeful.  He
resolved, as he lay down in bed, to keep the candle alight
until he began to grow sleepy, for there was something
unendurably depressing in the bare idea of laying awake in the
darkness, listening to the dismal, ceaseless moaning of the
wind in the wood.
</p>

<p>
Sleep stole on him before he was aware of it.  His eyes
closed, and he fell off insensibly to rest without having so
much as thought of extinguishing the candle.
</p>

<p>
The first sensation of which he was conscious after
sinking into slumber was a strange shivering that ran through
him suddenly from head to foot, and a dreadful sinking pain
at the heart, such as he had never felt before.  The shivering
only disturbed his slumbers; the pain woke him instantly.
In one moment he passed from a state of sleep to a state
of wakefulness&mdash;his eyes wide open&mdash;his mental perceptions
cleared on a sudden as if by a miracle.
</p>

<p>
The candle had burned down nearly to the last morsel
of tallow, but the top of the unsnuffed wick had just fallen
off, and the light in the little room was, for the moment, fair
and full.
</p>

<p>
Between the foot of the bed and the closed door there
stood a woman with a knife in her hand, looking at him.
</p>

<p>
He was stricken speechless with terror, but he did not
lose the preternatural clearness of his faculties, and he
never took his eyes off the woman.  She said not a word
as they stared each other in the face, but she began to move
slowly toward the left-hand side of the bed.
</p>

<p>
His eyes followed her.  She was a fair, fine woman, with
yellowish flaxen hair and light-gray eyes, with a droop in
the left eyelid.  He noticed those things, and fixed them on
his mind before she was round at the side of the bed.
Speechless, with no expression in her face, with no noise
following her footfall, she came closer and closer&mdash;stopped
and slowly raised the knife.  He laid his right arm over his
throat to save it; but, as he saw the knife coming down,
threw his hand across the bed to the right side, and jerked his
body over that way just as the knife descended on the
mattress within an inch of his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
His eyes fixed on her arm and hand as she slowly drew
her knife out of the bed; a white, well-shaped arm, with a
pretty down lying lightly over the fair skin&mdash;a delicate lady's
hand; with the crowning beauty of a pink flush under and
round the finger nails.
</p>

<p>
She drew the knife out, and passed again slowly to the
foot of the bed; stopped there for a moment looking at
him; then came on&mdash;still speechless, still with no expression
on the blank, beautiful face, still with no sound following
the stealthy footfalls&mdash;came on to the right side of the bed
where he now lay.
</p>

<p>
As she approached, she raised the knife again, and he
drew himself away to the left side.  She struck, as before,
right into the mattress, with a deliberate, perpendicularly
downward action of the arm.  This time his eyes wandered
from her to the knife.  It was like the large clasp-knives
which he had often seen laboring men use to cut their bread
and bacon with.  Her delicate little fingers did not conceal
more than two-thirds of the handle; he noticed that it was
made of buckhorn, clean and shining the blade was, and
looking like new.
</p>

<p>
For the second time she drew the knife out, concealed it
in the wide sleeve of her gown, then stopped by the
bedside, watching him.  For an instant he saw her standing
in that position, then the wick of the spent candle fell over
into the socket, the flame diminished to a little blue point,
and the room grew dark.
</p>

<p>
A moment, or less, if possible, passed so, and then the
wick flamed up, smokingly, for the last time.  His eyes were
still looking eagerly over the right-hand side of the bed when
the final flash of light came, but they discerned nothing.
The fair woman with the knife was gone.
</p>

<p>
The conviction that he was alone again weakened the
hold of the terror that had struck him dumb up to this time.
The preternatural sharpness which the very intensity of his
panic had mysteriously imparted to his faculties left them
suddenly.  His brain grew confused&mdash;his heart beat wildly&mdash;his
ears opened for the first time since the appearance of the
woman to a sense of the woful, ceaseless moaning of the
wind among the trees.  With the dreadful conviction of the
reality of what he had seen still strong within him, he leaped
out of bed, and screaming, "Murder!  Wake up there! wake
up!" dashed headlong through the darkness to the door.
</p>

<p>
It was fast locked, exactly as he had left it on going to
bed.
</p>

<p>
His cries on starting up had alarmed the house.  He
heard the terrified, confused exclamations of women; he
saw the master of the house approaching along the passage
with his burning rush-candle in one hand and his gun
in the other.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" asked the landlord, breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
Isaac could only answer in a whisper.  "A woman, with
a knife in her hand," he gasped out.  "In my room&mdash;a fair,
yellow-haired woman; she jobbed at me with the knife twice
over."
</p>

<p>
The landlord's pale cheeks grew paler.  He looked at
Isaac eagerly by the flickering light of his candle, and his
face began to get red again; his voice altered, too, as well
as his complexion.
</p>

<p>
"She seems to have missed you twice," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I dodged the knife as it came down," Isaac went on, in
the same scared whisper.  "It struck the bed each time."
</p>

<p>
The landlord took his candle into the bedroom immediately.
In less than a minute he came out again into the
passage in a violent passion.
</p>

<p>
"The devil fly away with you and your woman with the
knife!  There isn't a mark in the bedclothes anywhere.
What do you mean by coming into a man's place, and
frightening his family out of their wits about a dream?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll leave your house," said Isaac, faintly.  "Better out on
the road, in rain and dark, on my road home, than back again
in that room, after what I've seen in it.  Lend me a light
to get my clothes by, and tell me what I'm to pay."
</p>

<p>
"Pay!" cried the landlord, leading the way with his light
sulkily into the bedroom.  "You'll find your score on the
slate when you go downstairs.  I wouldn't have taken you
in for all the money you've got about you if I'd known your
dreaming, screeching ways beforehand.  Look at the bed.
Where's the cut of a knife in it?  Look at the window&mdash;is the
lock bursted?  Look at the door (which I heard you fasten
yourself)&mdash;is it broke in?  A murdering woman with a
knife in my house!  You ought to be ashamed of yourself!"
</p>

<p>
Isaac answered not a word.  He huddled on his clothes,
and they went downstairs together.
</p>

<p>
"Nigh on twenty minutes past two!" said the landlord,
as they passed a clock.  "A nice time in the morning to
frighten honest people out of their wits!"
</p>

<p>
Isaac paid his bill, and the landlord let him out at the
front door, asking, with a grin of contempt, as he undid the
strong fastenings, whether "the murdering woman got in
that way?"
</p>

<p>
They parted without a word on either side.  The rain
had ceased, but the night was dark, and the wind bleaker
than ever.  Little did the darkness or the cold or the
uncertainty about the way home matter to Isaac.  If he had
been turned out into the wilderness in a thunderstorm, it
would have been a relief after what he had suffered in the
bedroom of the inn.
</p>

<p>
What was the fair woman with the knife?  The creature
of a dream, or that other creature from the unknown world
called among men by the name of ghost?  He could make
nothing of the mystery&mdash;had made nothing of it, even when
it was midday on Wednesday, and when he stood, at last,
after many times missing his road, once more on the
doorstep of home.
</p>

<p>
His mother came out eagerly to receive him.  His face
told her in a moment that something was wrong.
</p>

<p>
"I've lost the place; but that's my luck.  I dreamed an
ill dream last night, mother&mdash;or maybe I saw a ghost.  Take
it either way, it scared me out of my senses, and I am not
my own man again yet."
</p>

<p>
"Isaac, your face frightens me.  Come into the fire&mdash;come
in, and tell mother all about it."
</p>

<p>
He was as anxious to tell as she was to hear: for it had
been his hope, all the way home, that his mother, with her
quicker capacity and superior knowledge, might be able to
throw some light on the mystery which he could not clear
up for himself.  His memory of the dream was still mechanically
vivid, though his thoughts were entirely confused by it.
</p>

<p>
His mother's face grew paler and paler as he went on.
She never interrupted him by so much as a single word; but
when he had done, she moved her chair close to his, put
her arms around his neck, and said to him:
</p>

<p>
"Isaac, you dreamed your ill dream on this Wednesday
morning.  What time was it when you saw the fair woman
with a knife in her hand?"
</p>

<p>
Isaac reflected on what the landlord had said when they
had passed by the clock on his leaving the inn; allowed
as nearly as he could for the time that must have elapsed
between the unlocking of his bedroom door and the paying
of his bill just before going away, and answered:
</p>

<p>
"Somewhere about two o'clock in the morning."
</p>

<p>
His mother suddenly quitted her hold of his neck, and
struck her hands together with a gesture of despair.
</p>

<p>
"This Wednesday is your birthday, Isaac, and two o'clock
in the morning was the time when you were born."
</p>

<p>
Isaac's capacities were not quick enough to catch the
infection of his mother's superstitious dread.  He was
amazed, and a little startled also, when she suddenly rose
from her chair, opened her old writing-desk, took pen, ink,
and paper, and then said to him:
</p>

<p>
"Your memory is but a poor one, Isaac, and now I'm
an old woman mine's not much better.  I want all about
this dream of yours to be as well known to both of us, years
hence, as it is now.  Tell me over again all you told me a
minute ago, when you spoke of what the woman with the
knife looked like."
</p>

<p>
Isaac obeyed, and marveled much as he saw his mother
carefully set down on paper the very words that he was
saying.
</p>

<p>
"Light-gray eyes," she wrote, as they came to the descriptive
part, "with a droop in the left eyelid; flaxen hair, with
a gold-yellow streak in it; white arms, with a down upon
them; little lady's hand, with a reddish look about the
finger nails; clasp-knife with a buckhorn handle, that seemed
as good as new."  To these particulars Mrs. Scatchard added
the year, month, day of the week, and time in the morning
when the woman of the dream appeared to her son.  She then
locked up the paper carefully in the writing-desk.
</p>

<p>
Neither on that day nor on any day after could her son
induce her to return to the matter of the dream.  She
obstinately kept her thoughts about it to herself, and even
refused to refer again to the paper in her writing-desk.  Ere
long Isaac grew weary of attempting to make her break
her resolute silence; and time, which sooner or later wears
out all things, gradually wore out the impression produced
on him by the dream.  He began by thinking of it carelessly,
and he ended by not thinking of it at all.
</p>

<p>
The result was the more easily brought about by the
advent of some important changes for the better in his
prospects, which commenced not long after his terrible
night's experience at the inn.  He reaped at last the reward
of his long and patient suffering under adversity by getting
an excellent place, keeping it for seven years, and leaving
it, on the death of his master, not only with an excellent
character, but also with a comfortable annuity bequeathed
to him as a reward for saving his mistress's life in a
carriage accident.  Thus it happened that Isaac Scatchard
returned to his old mother, seven years after the time of the
dream at the inn, with an annual sum of money at his
disposal sufficient to keep them both in ease and independence
for the rest of their lives.
</p>

<p>
The mother, whose health had been bad of late years,
profited so much by the care bestowed on her and by freedom
from money anxieties, that when Isaac's birthday came
round she was able to sit up comfortably at table and dine
with him.
</p>

<p>
On that day, as the evening drew on, Mrs. Scatchard
discovered that a bottle of tonic medicine which she was
accustomed to take, and in which she had fancied that a
dose or more was still left, happened to be empty.  Isaac
immediately volunteered to go to the chemist's and get it
filled again.  It was as rainy and bleak an autumn night
as on the memorable past occasion when he lost his way
and slept at the roadside inn.
</p>

<p>
On going into the chemist's shop he was passed hurriedly
by a poorly dressed woman coming out of it.  The
glimpse he had of her face struck him, and he looked back
after her as she descended the door steps.
</p>

<p>
"You're noticing that woman?" said the chemist's apprentice
behind the counter.  "It's my opinion there's something
wrong with her.  She's been asking for laudanum to put to
a bad tooth.  Master's out for half an hour, and I told her
I wasn't allowed to sell poison to strangers in his absence.
She laughed in a queer way, and said she would come back
in half an hour.  If she expects master to serve her, I think
she'll be disappointed.  It's a case of suicide, sir, if ever
there was one yet."
</p>

<p>
These words added immeasurably to the sudden interest
in the woman which Isaac had felt at the first sight of her
face.  After he had got the medicine-bottle filled, he looked
about anxiously for her as soon as he was out in the street.
She was walking slowly up and down on the opposite side
of the road.  With his heart, very much to his own surprise,
beating fast, Isaac crossed over and spoke to her.
</p>

<p>
He asked if she was in any distress.  She pointed to her
torn shawl, her scanty dress, her crushed, dirty bonnet; then
moved under a lamp so as to let the light fall on her stern,
pale, but still most beautiful face.
</p>

<p>
"I look like a comfortable, happy woman, don't I?" she
said, with a bitter laugh.
</p>

<p>
She spoke with a purity of intonation which Isaac had
never heard before from other lips than ladies' lips.  Her
slightest action seemed to have the easy, negligent grace
of a thoroughbred woman.  Her skin, for all its poverty-stricken
paleness, was as delicate as if her life had been
passed in the enjoyment of every social comfort that wealth
can purchase.  Even her small, finely shaped hands,
gloveless as they were, had not lost their whiteness.
</p>

<p>
Little by little, in answer to his question, the sad story
of the woman came out.  There is no need to relate it here;
it is told over and over again in police reports and
paragraphs about attempted suicides.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Rebecca Murdoch," said the woman, as she
ended.  "I have ninepence left, and I thought of spending
it at the chemist's over the way in securing a passage to
the other world.  Whatever it is, it can't be worse to me
than this, so why should I stop here?"
</p>

<p>
Besides the natural compassion and sadness moved in
his heart by what he heard, Isaac felt within him some
mysterious influence at work all the time the woman was
speaking which utterly confused his ideas and almost deprived
him of his powers of speech.  All that he could say in
answer to her last reckless words was that he would prevent
her from attempting her own life, if he followed her about
all night to do it.  His rough, trembling earnestness seemed
to impress her.
</p>

<p>
"I won't occasion you that trouble," she answered, when
he repeated his threat.  "You have given me a fancy for
living by speaking kindly to me.  No need for the mockery
of protestations and promises.  You may believe me without
them.  Come to Fuller's Meadow to-morrow at twelve,
and you will find me alive, to answer for myself&mdash;  No!&mdash;no
money.  My ninepence will do to get me as good a night's
lodging as I want."
</p>

<p>
She nodded and left him.  He made no attempt to
follow&mdash;he felt no suspicion that she was deceiving him.
</p>

<p>
"It's strange, but I can't help believing her," he said to
himself, and walked away, bewildered, toward home.
</p>

<p>
On entering the house his mind was still so completely
absorbed by its new subject of interest that he took no
notice of what his mother was doing when he came in with
the bottle of medicine.  She had opened her old writing-desk
in his absence, and was now reading a paper attentively
that lay inside it.  On every birthday of Isaac's since
she had written down the particulars of his dream from his
own lips, she had been accustomed to read that same paper,
and ponder over it in private.
</p>

<p>
The next day he went to Fuller's Meadow.
</p>

<p>
He had done only right in believing her so implicitly.
She was there, punctual to a minute, to answer for herself.
The last-left faint defenses in Isaac's heart against the
fascination which a word or look from her began inscrutably to
exercise over him sank down and vanished before her
forever on that memorable morning.
</p>

<p>
When a man previously insensible to the influence of
woman forms an attachment in middle life, the instances
are rare indeed, let the warning circumstances be what they
may, in which he is found capable of freeing himself from
the tyranny of the new ruling passion.  The charm of being
spoken to familiarly, fondly, and gratefully by a woman
whose language and manners still retained enough of their
early refinement to hint at the high social station that she
had lost, would have been a dangerous luxury to a man of
Isaac's rank at the age of twenty.  But it was far more than
that&mdash;it was certain ruin to him&mdash;now that his heart was
opening unworthily to a new influence at that middle time
of life when strong feelings of all kinds, once implanted,
strike root most stubbornly in a man's moral nature.  A
few more stolen interviews after that first morning in
Fuller's Meadow completed his infatuation.  In less than
a month from the time when he first met her, Isaac Scatchard
had consented to give Rebecca Murdoch a new interest
in existence and a chance of recovering the character she
had lost by promising to make her his wife.
</p>

<p>
She had taken possession, not of his passions only, but
of his faculties as well.  All the mind he had he put into
her keeping.  She directed him on every point&mdash;even
instructing him how to break the news of his approaching
marriage in the safest manner to his mother.
</p>

<p>
"If you tell her how you met me and who I am at first,"
said the cunning woman, "she will move heaven and earth
to prevent our marriage.  Say I am the sister of one of your
fellow-servants&mdash;ask her to see me before you go into any
more particulars&mdash;and leave it to me to do the rest.  I mean
to make her love me next best to you, Isaac, before she
knows anything of who I really am."
</p>

<p>
The motive of the deceit was sufficient to sanctify it to
Isaac.  The stratagem proposed relieved him of his one great
anxiety, and quieted his uneasy conscience on the subject of
his mother.  Still, there was something wanting to perfect
his happiness, something that he could not realize,
something mysteriously untraceable, and yet something that
perpetually made itself felt; not when he was absent from
Rebecca Murdoch, but, strange to say, when he was actually
in her presence!  She was kindness itself with him.  She
never made him feel his inferior capacities and inferior
manners.  She showed the sweetest anxiety to please him in
the smallest trifles; but, in spite of all these attractions, he
never could feel quite at his ease with her.  At their first
meeting there had mingled with his admiration, when he
looked in her face, a faint, involuntary feeling of doubt
whether that face was entirely strange to him.  No
after-familiarity had the slightest effect on this inexplicable,
wearisome uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
Concealing the truth as he had been directed, he announced
his marriage engagement precipitately and confusedly
to his mother on the day when he contracted it.  Poor
Mrs. Scatchard showed her perfect confidence in her son by
flinging her arms round his neck, and giving him joy of
having found at last, in the sister of one of his
fellow-servants, a woman to comfort and care for him after his
mother was gone.  She was all eagerness to see the woman
of her son's choice, and the next day was fixed for the
introduction.
</p>

<p>
It was a bright sunny morning, and the little cottage
parlor was full of light as Mrs. Scatchard, happy and
expectant, dressed for the occasion in her Sunday gown, sat
waiting for her son and her future daughter-in-law.
</p>

<p>
Punctual to the appointed time, Isaac hurriedly and
nervously led his promised wife into the room.  His mother
rose to receive her&mdash;advanced a few steps smiling&mdash;looked
Rebecca full in the eyes, and suddenly stopped.  Her face,
which had been flushed the moment before, turned white in
an instant; her eyes lost their expression of softness and
kindness, and assumed a blank look of terror; her
outstretched hands fell to her sides, and she staggered back
a few steps with a low cry to her son.
</p>

<p>
"Isaac," she whispered, clutching him fast by the arm
when he asked alarmedly if she was taken ill, "Isaac, does
that woman's face remind you of nothing?"
</p>

<p>
Before he could answer&mdash;before he could look round to
where Rebecca stood, astonished and angered by her reception,
at the lower end of the room&mdash;his mother pointed
impatiently to her writing-desk, and gave him the key.
</p>

<p>
"Open it," she said, in a quick, breathless whisper.
</p>

<p>
"What does this mean?  Why am I treated as if I had
no business here?  Does your mother want to insult me?"
asked Rebecca, angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Open it, and give me the paper in the left-hand drawer.
Quick! quick, for Heaven's sake!" said Mrs. Scatchard,
shrinking further back in terror.
</p>

<p>
Isaac gave her the paper.  She looked it over eagerly for
a moment, then followed Rebecca, who was now turning
away haughtily to leave the room, and caught her by the
shoulder&mdash;abruptly raised the long, loose sleeve of her gown,
and glanced at her hand and arm.  Something like fear
began to steal over the angry expression of Rebecca's face
as she shook herself free from the old woman's grasp.
"Mad!" she said to herself, "and Isaac never told me."  With
these few words she left the room.
</p>

<p>
Isaac was hastening after her when his mother turned
and stopped his further progress.  It wrung his heart to
see the misery and terror in her face as she looked at him.
</p>

<p>
"Light-gray eyes," she said, in low, mournful, awe-struck
tones, pointing toward the open door; "a droop in the left
eyelid; flaxen hair, with a gold-yellow streak in it; white
arms, with a down upon them; little lady's hand, with a
reddish look under the finger nails&mdash;The Dream-Woman, Isaac,
the Dream-Woman!"
</p>

<p>
That faint cleaving doubt which he had never been able
to shake off in Rebecca Murdoch's presence was fatally set
at rest forever.  He had seen her face, then, before&mdash;seven
years before, on his birthday, in the bedroom of the lonely
inn.
</p>

<p>
"Be warned!  oh, my son, be warned!  Isaac, Isaac, let her
go, and do you stop with me!"
</p>

<p>
Something darkened the parlor window as those words
were said.  A sudden chill ran through him, and he glanced
sidelong at the shadow.  Rebecca Murdoch had come back.
She was peering in curiously at them over the low
window-blind.
</p>

<p>
"I have promised to marry, mother," he said, "and marry
I must."
</p>

<p>
The tears came into his eyes as he spoke and dimmed
his sight, but he could just discern the fatal face outside
moving away again from the window.
</p>

<p>
His mother's head sank lower.
</p>

<p>
"Are you faint?" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Broken-hearted, Isaac."
</p>

<p>
He stooped down and kissed her.  The shadow, as he did
so, returned to the window, and the fatal face peered in
curiously once more.
</p>

<p>
Three weeks after that day Isaac and Rebecca were man
and wife.  All that was hopelessly dogged and stubborn in
the man's moral nature seemed to have closed round his
fatal passion, and to have fixed it unassailably in his heart.
</p>

<p>
After that first interview in the cottage parlor no
consideration would induce Mrs. Scatchard to see her son's
wife again, or even to talk of her when Isaac tried hard
to plead her cause after their marriage.
</p>

<p>
This course of conduct was not in any degree occasioned
by a discovery of the degradation in which Rebecca had
lived.  There was no question of that between mother and
son.  There was no question of anything but the fearfully
exact resemblance between the living, breathing woman
and the spectre-woman of Isaac's dream.
</p>

<p>
Rebecca, on her side, neither felt nor expressed the
slightest sorrow at the estrangement between herself and
her mother-in-law.  Isaac, for the sake of peace, had never
contradicted her first idea that age and long illness had
affected Mrs. Scatchard's mind.  He even allowed his wife
to upbraid him for not having confessed this to her at the
time of their marriage engagement rather than risk anything
by hinting at the truth.  The sacrifice of his integrity
before his one all-mastering delusion seemed but a small
thing, and cost his conscience but little after the sacrifices
he had already made.
</p>

<p>
The time of waking from this delusion&mdash;the cruel and the
rueful time&mdash;was not far off.  After some quiet months of
married life, as the summer was ending, and the year was
getting on toward the month of his birthday, Isaac found
his wife altering toward him.  She grew sullen and
contemptuous; she formed acquaintances of the most dangerous
kind in defiance of his objections, his entreaties, and his
commands; and, worst of all, she learned, erelong, after
every fresh difference with her husband, to seek the deadly
self-oblivion of drink.  Little by little, after the first
miserable discovery that his wife was keeping company with
drunkards, the shocking certainty forced itself on Isaac that
she had grown to be a drunkard herself.
</p>

<p>
He had been in a sadly desponding state for some time
before the occurrence of these domestic calamities.  His
mother's health, as he could but too plainly discern every
time he went to see her at the cottage, was failing fast,
and he upbraided himself in secret as the cause of the bodily
and mental suffering she endured.  When to his remorse
on his mother's account was added the shame and misery
occasioned by the discovery of his wife's degradation, he
sank under the double trial&mdash;his face began to alter fast,
and he looked what he was, a spirit-broken man.
</p>

<p>
His mother, still struggling bravely against the illness that
was hurrying her to the grave, was the first to notice the sad
alteration in him, and the first to hear of his last worst
trouble with his wife.  She could only weep bitterly on the
day when he made his humiliating confession, but on the
next occasion when he went to see her she had taken a
resolution in reference to his domestic afflictions which
astonished and even alarmed him.  He found her dressed to go
out, and on asking the reason received this answer:
</p>

<p>
"I am not long for this world, Isaac," she said, "and I
shall not feel easy on my death-bed unless I have done my
best to the last to make my son happy.  I mean to put my
own fears and my own feelings out of the question, and to
go with you to your wife, and try what I can do to reclaim
her.  Give me your arm, Isaac, and let me do the last
thing I can in this world to help my son before it is too
late."
</p>

<p>
He could not disobey her, and they walked together
slowly toward his miserable home.
</p>

<p>
It was only one o'clock in the afternoon when they
reached the cottage where he lived.  It was their dinner-hour,
and Rebecca was in the kitchen.  He was thus able
to take his mother quietly into the parlor, and then prepare
his wife for the interview.  She had fortunately drunk but
little at that early hour, and she was less sullen and
capricious than usual.
</p>

<p>
He returned to his mother with his mind tolerably at
ease.  His wife soon followed him into the parlor, and the
meeting between her and Mrs. Scatchard passed off better
than he had ventured to anticipate, though he observed
with secret apprehension that his mother, resolutely as she
controlled herself in other respects, could not look his wife
in the face when she spoke to her.  It was a relief to him,
therefore, when Rebecca began to lay the cloth.
</p>

<p>
She laid the cloth, brought in the bread-tray, and cut a
slice from the loaf for her husband, then returned to the
kitchen.  At that moment, Isaac, still anxiously watching
his mother, was startled by seeing the same ghastly change
pass over her face which had altered it so awfully on the
morning when Rebecca and she first met.  Before he could
say a word, she whispered, with a look of horror:
</p>

<p>
"Take me back&mdash;home, home again, Isaac.  Come with
me, and never go back again."
</p>

<p>
He was afraid to ask for an explanation; he could only
sign to her to be silent, and help her quickly to the door.
As they passed the bread-tray on the table she stopped and
pointed to it.
</p>

<p>
"Did you see what your wife cut your bread with?" she
asked, in a low whisper.
</p>

<p>
"No, mother&mdash;I was not noticing&mdash;what was it?"
</p>

<p>
"Look!"
</p>

<p>
He did look.  A new clasp-knife, with a buckhorn handle,
lay with the loaf in the bread-tray.  He stretched out his
hand shudderingly to possess himself of it; but, at the same
time, there was a noise in the kitchen, and his mother
caught at his arm.
</p>

<p>
"The knife of the dream!  Isaac, I'm faint with fear.
Take me away before she comes back."
</p>

<p>
He was hardly able to support her.  The visible, tangible
reality of the knife struck him with a panic, and utterly
destroyed any faint doubts that he might have entertained up
to this time in relation to the mysterious dream-warning of
nearly eight years before.  By a last desperate effort, he
summoned self-possession enough to help his mother out of
the house&mdash;so quietly that the "Dream-Woman" (he thought
of her by that name now) did not hear them departing from
the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go back, Isaac&mdash;don't go back!" implored Mrs. Scatchard,
as he turned to go away, after seeing her safely
seated again in her own room.
</p>

<p>
"I must get the knife," he answered, under his breath.
His mother tried to stop him again, but he hurried out
without another word.
</p>

<p>
On his return he found that his wife had discovered their
secret departure from the house.  She had been drinking,
and was in a fury of passion.  The dinner in the kitchen
was flung under the grate; the cloth was off the parlor
table.  Where was the knife?
</p>

<p>
Unwisely, he asked for it.  She was only too glad of the
opportunity of irritating him which the request afforded
her.  He wanted the knife, did he?  Could he give her a
reason why?  No!  Then he should not have it&mdash;not if he
went down on his knees to ask for it.  Further recrimination
elicited the fact that she had bought it a bargain, and
that she considered it her own especial property.  Isaac
saw the uselessness of attempting to get the knife by fair
means, and determined to search for it, later in the day, in
secret.  The search was unsuccessful.  Night came on, and
he left the house to walk about the streets.  He was afraid
now to sleep in the same room with her.
</p>

<p>
Three weeks passed.  Still sullenly enraged with him,
she would not give up the knife; and still that fear of
sleeping in the same room with her possessed him.  He walked
about at night, or dozed in the parlor, or sat watching by
his mother's bedside.  Before the expiration of the first week
in the new month his mother died.  It wanted then but ten
days of her son's birthday.  She had longed to live till that
anniversary.  Isaac was present at her death, and her last
words in this world were addressed to him:
</p>

<p>
"Don't go back, my son, don't go back!"
</p>

<p>
He was obliged to go back, if it were only to watch his
wife.  Exasperated to the last degree by his distrust of her,
she had revengefully sought to add a sting to his grief,
during the last days of his mother's illness, by declaring that
she would assert her right to attend the funeral.  In spite of
all that he could do or say, she held with wicked pertinacity
to her word, and on the day appointed for the burial forced
herself&mdash;inflamed and shameless with drink&mdash;into her
husband's presence, and declared that she would walk in the
funeral procession to his mother's grave.
</p>

<p>
This last worst outrage, accompanied by all that was
most insulting in word and look, maddened him for the
moment.  He struck her.
</p>

<p>
The instant the blow was dealt he repented it.  She
crouched down, silent, in a corner of the room, and eyed
him steadily; it was a look that cooled his hot blood and
made him tremble.  But there was no time now to think of
a means of making atonement.  Nothing remained but to risk
the worst till the funeral was over.  There was but one way
of making sure of her.  He locked her in her bedroom.
</p>

<p>
When he came back some hours after, he found her sitting,
very much altered in look and bearing, by the bedside, with
a bundle on her lap.  She rose and faced him quietly, and
spoke with a strange stillness in her voice, a strange repose
in her eyes, a strange composure in her manner.
</p>

<p>
"No man has ever struck me twice," she said, "and my
husband shall have no second opportunity.  Set the door
open and let me go.  From this day forth we see each other
no more."
</p>

<p>
Before he could answer she passed him and left the
room.  He saw her walk away up the street.
</p>

<p>
Would she return?
</p>

<p>
All that night he watched and waited, but no footstep
came near the house.  The next night, overpowered by fatigue,
he lay down in bed in his clothes, with the door locked,
the key on the table, and the candle burning.  His slumber
was not disturbed.  The third night, the fourth, the fifth, the
sixth passed, and nothing happened.  He lay down on the
seventh, still in his clothes, still with the door locked,
the key on the table, and the candle burning, but easier in
his mind.
</p>

<p>
Easier in his mind, and in perfect health of body when he
fell off to sleep.  But his rest was disturbed.  He woke twice
without any sensation of uneasiness.  But the third time it
was that never-to-be-forgotten shivering of the night at the
lonely inn, that dreadful sinking pain at the heart, which
once more aroused him in an instant.
</p>

<p>
His eyes opened toward the left-hand side of the bed, and
there stood&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Dream-Woman again?  No!  his wife; the living reality,
with the dream-spectre's face, in the dream-spectre's attitude;
the fair arm up, the knife clasped in the delicate white
hand.
</p>

<p>
He sprang upon her almost at the instant of seeing her,
and yet not quickly enough to prevent her from hiding the
knife.  Without a word from him&mdash;without a cry from her&mdash;he
pinioned her in a chair.  With one hand he felt up her
sleeve, and there, where the Dream-Woman had hidden the
knife, his wife had hidden it&mdash;the knife with the buckhorn
handle, that looked like new.
</p>

<p>
In the despair of that fearful moment his brain was steady,
his heart was calm.  He looked at her fixedly with the knife
in his hand, and said these last words:
</p>

<p>
"You have told me we should see each other no more,
and you have come back.  It is now my turn to go, and to
go forever.  I say that we shall see each other no more, and
my word shall not be broken."
</p>

<p>
He left her, and set forth into the night.  There was
a bleak wind abroad, and the smell of recent rain was in
the air.  The distant church-clocks chimed the quarter as he
walked rapidly beyond the last houses in the suburb.  He
asked the first policeman he met what hour that was of
which the quarter past had just struck.
</p>

<p>
The man referred sleepily to his watch, and answered,
"Two o'clock."  Two in the morning.  What day of the
month was this day that had just begun?  He reckoned it
up from the date of his mother's funeral.  The fatal parallel
was complete: it was his birthday!
</p>

<p>
Had he escaped the mortal peril which his dream
foretold? or had he only received a second warning?
</p>

<p>
As that ominous doubt forced itself on his mind, he
stopped, reflected, and turned back again toward the city.
He was still resolute to hold to his word, and never to let
her see him more; but there was a thought now in his mind
of having her watched and followed.  The knife was in his
possession; the world was before him; but a new distrust of
her&mdash;a vague, unspeakable, superstitious dread&mdash;had come
over him.
</p>

<p>
"I must know where she goes, now she thinks I have left
her," he said to himself, as he stole back wearily to the
precincts of his house.
</p>

<p>
It was still dark.  He had left the candle burning in the
bed-chamber; but when he looked up to the window of the
room now, there was no light in it.  He crept cautiously
to the house door.  On going away, he remembered to have
closed it; on trying it now, he found it open.
</p>

<p>
He waited outside, never losing sight of the house, till
daylight.  Then he ventured indoors&mdash;listened, and heard
nothing&mdash;looked into kitchen, scullery, parlor, and found
nothing; went up, at last, into the bedroom&mdash;it was empty.
A picklock lay on the floor, betraying how she had gained
entrance in the night, and that was the only trace of her.
</p>

<p>
Whither had she gone?  That no mortal tongue could tell
him.  The darkness had covered her flight; and when the day
broke no man could say where the light found her.
</p>

<p>
Before leaving the house and the town forever, he gave
instructions to a friend and neighbor to sell his furniture for
anything that it would fetch, and apply the proceeds to
employing the police to trace her.  The directions were honestly
followed, and the money was all spent, but the inquiries led
to nothing.  The picklock on the bedroom floor remained the
one last useless trace of the Dream-Woman.

*From "The Sin-Eater."
</p>

<p class="t3">
By FIONA MACLEOD
</p>

<p>
In the year that followed the death of Manus
MacCodrum, James Achanna saw nothing of his brother
Gloom.  He might have thought himself alone in
the world, of all his people, but for a letter that
came to him out of the west.  True, he had never accepted the
common opinion that his brothers had both been drowned on
that night when Anne Gillespie left Eilanmore with Manus.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, he had nothing of that inner conviction
concerning the fate of Gloom which he had concerning that
of Marcus; in the next, had he not heard the sound of the
<i>feadan</i>, which no one that he knew played except Gloom;
and, for further token, was not the tune that which he hated
above all others&mdash;the "Dance of the Dead"&mdash;for who but
Gloom would be playing that, he hating it so, and the hour
being late, and no one else on Eilanmore?  It was no sure
thing that the dead had not come back; but the more he
thought of it the more Achanna believed that his sixth
brother was still alive.  Of this, however, he said nothing to
any one.
</p>

<p>
It was as a man set free that, at last, after long waiting
and patient trouble with the disposal of all that was left of
the Achanna heritage, he left the island.  It was a gray
memory for him.  The bleak moorland of it, the blight that had
lain so long and so often upon the crops, the rains that had
swept the isle for gray days and gray weeks and gray months,
the sobbing of the sea by day and its dark moan by night,
its dim relinquishing sigh in the calm of dreary ebbs, its
hollow, baffling roar when the storm-shadow swept up out
of the sea&mdash;one and all oppressed him, even in memory.  He
had never loved the island, even when it lay green and
fragrant in the green and white seas under white and blue
skies, fresh and sweet as an Eden of the sea.
</p>

<p>
He had ever been lonely and weary, tired of the mysterious
shadow that lay upon his folk, caring little for any of
his brothers except the eldest&mdash;long since mysteriously gone
out of the ken of man&mdash;and almost hating Gloom, who had
ever borne him a grudge because of his beauty, and because
of his likeness to and reverent heed for Alison.  Moreover,
ever since he had come to love Katreen Macarthur, the
daughter of Donald Macarthur who lived in Sleat of Skye,
he had been eager to live near her; the more eager as he
knew that Gloom loved the girl also, and wished for success
not only for his own sake, but so as to put a slight upon his
younger brother.
</p>

<p>
So, when at last he left the island, he sailed southward
gladly.  He was leaving Eilanmore; he was bound to a new
home in Skye, and perhaps he was going to his long-delayed,
long dreamed-of happiness.  True, Katreen was not pledged
to him; he did not even know for sure if she loved him.  He
thought, hoped, dreamed, almost believed that she did; but
then there was her cousin Ian, who had long wooed her, and
to whom old Donald Macarthur had given his blessing.
Nevertheless, his heart would have been lighter than it had
been for long, but for two things.  First, there was the letter.
Some weeks earlier he had received it, not recognizing the
writing, because of the few letters he had ever seen, and,
moreover, as it was in a feigned hand.  With difficulty he had
deciphered the manuscript, plain printed though it was.  It
ran thus:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Well, Sheumais, my brother, it is wondering if I am dead, you will be.
Maybe ay, and maybe no.
But I send you this writing to let you see
that I know all you do and think of.
So you are going to leave Eilanmore
without an Achanna upon it?
And you will be going to Sleat in Skye?
Well, let me be telling you this thing.  <i>Do not go</i>.
I see blood there.  And
there is this, too: neither you nor any man
shall take Katreen away from
me.  <i>You</i> know that; and Ian Macarthur knows it;
and Katreen knows it;
and that holds whether I am alive or dead.
I say to you: do not go.  It
will be better for you, and for all.
Ian Macarthur is away in the north-sea
with the whaler-captain who came to us at Eilanmore,
and will not be back
for three months yet.
It will be better for him not to come back.  But if
he comes back he will have to reckon with the man
who says that Katreen
Macarthur is his.
I would rather not have two men to speak to, and one
my brother.  It does not matter to you where I am.
I want no money just
now.  But put aside my portion for me.
Have it ready for me against the
day I call for it.
I will not be patient that day; so have it ready for me.
In the place that I am I am content.
You will be saying: why is my brother
away in a remote place (I will say this to you:
that it is not further north
than St. Kilda nor further south than the Mull
of Cantyrel), and for what
reason?  That is between me and silence.
But perhaps you think of Anne
sometimes.  Do you know that she lies under the green grass?
And of
Manus MacCodrum?
They say that he swam out into the sea and was
drowned; and they whisper of the seal-blood,
though the minister is wrath
with them for that.  He calls it a madness.
Well, I was there at that madness,
and I played to it on my <i>feadan</i>.
And now, Sheumais, can you be
thinking of what the tune was that I played?
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Your brother, who waits his own day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"GLOOM.<br>
</p>

<p>
"Do not be forgetting this thing:
<i>I would rather not be playing the
'Damhsa-na-Mairbh.'</i>  It was an ill hour
for Manus when he heard the
'Dan-nan-Ron'; it was the song of his soul, that;
and yours is the
'Davsa-na-Mairv.'"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This letter was ever in his mind: this, and what happened
in the gloaming when he sailed away for Skye in the
herring-smack of two men who lived at Armadale in Sleat.  For,
as the boat moved slowly out of the haven, one of the men
asked him if he was sure that no one was left upon the
island; for he thought he had seen a figure on the rocks,
waving a black scarf.  Achanna shook his head; but just then
his companion cried that at that moment he had seen the
same thing.  So the smack was put about, and when she was
moving slowly through the haven again, Achanna sculled
ashore in the little coggly punt.  In vain he searched here
and there, calling loudly again and again.  Both men could
hardly have been mistaken, he thought.  If there were no
human creature on the island, and if their eyes had not
played them false, who could it be?  The wraith of Marcus,
mayhap; or might it be the old man himself (his father),
risen to bid farewell to his youngest son, or to warn him?
</p>

<p>
It was no use to wait longer, so, looking often behind
him, he made his way to the boat again, and rowed slowly
out toward the smack.
</p>

<p>
<i>Jerk&mdash;jerk&mdash;jerk</i> across the water came, low but only too
loud for him, the opening motif of the "Damhsa-na-Mairbh."
A horror came upon him, and he drove the boat through the
water so that the sea splashed over the bows.  When he
came on deck he cried in a hoarse voice to the man next
him to put up the helm, and let the smack swing to the wind.
</p>

<p>
"There is no one there, Callum Campbell," he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"And who is it that will be making that strange music?"
</p>

<p>
"What music?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure it has stopped now, but I heard it clear, and so
did Anndra MacEwan.  It was like the sound of a reed pipe,
and the tune was an eery one at that."
</p>

<p>
"It was the Dance of the Dead."
</p>

<p>
"And who will be playing that?" asked the man, with
fear in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"No living man."
</p>

<p>
"No living man?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I'm thinking it will be one of my brothers who
was drowned here, and by the same token that it is Gloom,
for he played upon the <i>feadan</i>.  But if not, then&mdash;then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The two men waited in breathless silence, each trembling
with superstitious fear; but at last the elder made a sign to
Achanna to finish.
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;it will be the Kelpie."
</p>

<p>
"Is there&mdash;is there one of the&mdash;cave-women here?"
</p>

<p>
"It is said; and you know of old that the Kelpie sings
or plays a strange tune to wile seamen to their death."
</p>

<p>
At that moment the fantastic, jerking music came loud
and clear across the bay.  There was a horrible suggestion
in it, as if dead bodies were moving along the ground with
long jerks, and crying and laughing wild.  It was enough;
the men, Campbell and MacEwan, would not now have
waited longer if Achanna had offered them all he had in the
world.  Nor were they, or he, out of their panic haste till
the smack stood well out at sea, and not a sound could be
heard from Eilanmore.
</p>

<p>
They stood watching, silent.  Out of the dusky mass that
lay in the seaward way to the north came a red gleam.  It
was like an eye staring after them with blood-red glances.
</p>

<p>
"What is that, Achanna?" asked one of the men at last.
</p>

<p>
"It looks as though a fire had been lighted in the house
up in the island.  The door and the window must be open.
The fire must be fed with wood, for no peats would give
that flame; and there were none lighted when I left.  To my
knowing, there was no wood for burning except the wood of
the shelves and the bed."
</p>

<p>
"And who would be doing that?"
</p>

<p>
"I know of that no more than you do, Callum Campbell."
</p>

<p>
No more was said, and it was a relief to all when the last
glimmer of the light was absorbed in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the voyage Campbell and MacEwan were
well pleased to be quit of their companion; not so much
because he was moody and distraught as because they feared
that a spell was upon him&mdash;a fate in the working of which
they might become involved.  It needed no vow of the one
to the other for them to come to the conclusion that they
would never land on Eilanmore, or, if need be, only in broad
daylight, and never alone.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The days went well for James Achanna, where he made
his home at Ranza-beag, on Ranza Water in the Sleat of
Skye.  The farm was small but good, and he hoped that
with help and care he would soon have the place as good a
farm as there was in all Skye.
</p>

<p>
Donald Macarthur did not let him see much of Katreen,
but the old man was no longer opposed to him.  Sheumais
must wait till Ian Macarthur came back again, which might
be any day now.  For sure, James Achanna of Ranza-beag
was a very different person from the youngest of the
Achanna-folk, who held by on lonely Eilanmore; moreover,
the old man could not but think with pleasure that it would
be well to see Katreen able to walk over the whole land of
Ranza, from the cairn at the north of his own Ranza-Mòr to
the burn at the south of Ranza-beag, and know it for her own.
</p>

<p>
But Achanna was ready to wait.  Even before he had the
secret word of Katreen he knew from her beautiful dark eyes
that she loved him.  As the weeks went by they managed to
meet often, and at last Katreen told him that she loved him
too, and would have none but him; but that they must wait
till Ian came back, because of the pledge given to him by
her father.  They were days of joy for him.  Through many
a hot noontide hour, through many a gloaming he went as
one in a dream.  Whenever he saw a birch swaying in the
wind, or a wave leaping upon Loch Liath, that was near his
home, or passed a bush covered with wild roses, or saw
the moonbeams lying white on the boles of the pines, he
thought of Katreen&mdash;his fawn for grace, and so lithe and
tall, with sunbrown face and wavy, dark mass of hair, and
shadowy eyes and rowan-red lips.  It is said that there is
a god clothed in shadow who goes to and fro among the
human kind, putting silence between lovers with his waving
hands, and breathing a chill out of his cold breath, and
leaving a gulf of deep water flowing between them because of
the passing of his feet.  That shadow never came their way.
Their love grew as a flower fed by rains and warmed by
sunlight.
</p>

<p>
When midsummer came, and there was no sign of Ian
Macarthur, it was already too late.  Katreen had been won.
</p>

<p>
During the summer months it was the custom for Katreen
and two of the farm-girls to go up Maol-Ranza, to reside
at the shealing of Cnoc-an-Fhraoch: and this because of the
hill-pasture for the sheep.  Cnoc-an-Fhraoch is a round,
boulder-studded hill covered with heather, which has a
precipitous corrie on each side, and in front slopes down to
Lochan Fraoch, a lochlet surrounded by dark woods.  Behind
the hill, or great hillock rather, lay the shealing.  At
each week-end Katreen went down to Ranza-Mòr, and on
every Monday morning at sunrise returned to her heather-girt
eyry.  It was on one of these visits that she endured
a cruel shock.  Her father told her that she must marry some
one else than Sheumais Achanna.  He had heard words
about him which made a union impossible, and indeed, he
hoped that the man would leave Ranza-beag.  In the end he
admitted that what he had heard was to the effect that
Achanna was under a doom of some kind, that he was involved
in a blood feud; and, moreover, that he was fey.  The
old man would not be explicit as to the person from whom
his information came, but hinted that he was a stranger of
rank, probably a laird of the isles.  Besides this, there was
word of Ian Macarthur.  He was at Thurso, in the far
north, and would be in Skye before long, and he&mdash;her
father&mdash;had written to him that he might wed Katreen as soon as
was practicable.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see that lintie yonder, father?" was her response
to this.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, lass, and what about the birdeen?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, when she mates with a hawk, so will I be mating
with Ian Macarthur, but not till then."
</p>

<p>
With that she turned and left the house, and went back
to Cnoc-an-Fhraoch.  On the way she met Achanna.
</p>

<p>
It was that night that for the first time he swam across
Lochan Fraoch to meet Katreen.
</p>

<p>
The quickest way to reach the shealing was to row
across the lochlet, and then ascend by a sheep-path that
wound through the hazel copses at the base of the hill.
Fully half an hour was thus saved, because of the steepness
of the precipitous corries to right and left.  A boat was
kept for this purpose, but it was fastened to a shore-boulder
by a padlocked iron chain, the key of which was kept by
Donald Macarthur.  Latterly he had refused to let this key
out of his possession.  For one thing, no doubt, he believed
he could thus restrain Achanna from visiting his daughter.
The young man could not approach the shealing from either
side without being seen.
</p>

<p>
But that night, soon after the moon was whitening slow
in the dark, Katreen stole down to the hazel copse and
awaited the coming of her lover.  The lochan was visible
from almost any point on Cnoc-an-Fhraoch, as well as from
the south side.  To cross it in a boat unseen, if any watcher
were near, would be impossible, nor could even a swimmer
hope to escape notice unless in the gloom of night or,
mayhap, in the dusk.  When, however, she saw, half-way across
the water, a spray of green branches slowly moving athwart
the surface, she knew that Sheumais was keeping his tryst.
If, perchance, any one else saw, he or she would never guess
that those derelict rowan branches shrouded Sheumais
Achanna.
</p>

<p>
It was not till the estray had drifted close to the ledge,
where, hid among the bracken and the hazel undergrowth,
she awaited him, that Katreen descried the face of her lover,
as with one hand he parted the green sprays, and stared
longingly and lovingly at the figure he could just discern in
the dim, fragrant obscurity.
</p>

<p>
And as it was this night so was it many of the nights
that followed.  Katreen spent the days as in a dream.  Not
even the news of her cousin Ian's return disturbed her much.
</p>

<p>
One day the inevitable meeting came.  She was at Ranza-Mòr,
and when a shadow came into the dairy where she was
standing she looked up, and saw Ian before her.  She thought
he appeared taller and stronger than ever, though still not
so tall as Sheumais, who would appear slim beside the
Herculean Skye man.  But as she looked at his close curling
black hair and thick bull-neck and the sullen eyes in his
dark wind-red face, she wondered that she had ever
tolerated him at all.
</p>

<p>
He broke the ice at once.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, Katreen, are you glad to see me back again?"
</p>

<p>
"I am glad that you are home once more safe and sound."
</p>

<p>
"And will you make it my home for me by coming to live
with me, as I've asked you again and again?"
</p>

<p>
"No: as I've told you again and again."
</p>

<p>
He gloomed at her angrily for a few moments before he
resumed.
</p>

<p>
"I will be asking you this one thing, Katreen, daughter
of my father's brother: do you love that man Achanna who
lives at Ranza-beag?"
</p>

<p>
"You may ask the wind why it is from the east or the
west, but it won't tell you.  You're not the wind's master."
</p>

<p>
"If you think I will let this man take you away from me,
you are thinking a foolish thing."
</p>

<p>
"And you saying a foolisher."
</p>

<p>
"Ay?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, sure.  What could you do, Ian Mhic Ian?  At the
worst, you could do no more than kill James Achanna.  What
then?  I too would die.  You can not separate us.  I would
not marry you, now, though you were the last man in the
world and I the last woman."
</p>

<p>
"You're a fool, Katreen Macarthur.  Your father has promised
you to me, and I tell you this: if you love Achanna you'll
save his life only by letting him go away from here.  I
promise you he will not be here long."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, you promise <i>me</i>; but you will not say that thing to
James Achanna's face.  You are a coward."
</p>

<p>
With a muttered oath the man turned on his heel.
</p>

<p>
"Let him beware o' me, and you, too, Katreen-mo-nighean-donn.
I swear it by my mother's grave and by St. Martin's
Cross that you will be mine by hook or by crook."
</p>

<p>
The girl smiled scornfully.  Slowly she lifted a milk-pail.
</p>

<p>
"It would be a pity to waste the good milk, Ian-gorach,
but if you don't go it is I that will be emptying the pail on
you, and then you will be as white without as your heart is
within."
</p>

<p>
"So you call me witless, do you?  <i>Ian-gorach</i>!  Well, we
shall be seeing as to that.  And as for the milk, there will
be more than milk spilt because of <i>you</i>, Katreen-donn."
</p>

<p>
From that day, though neither Sheumais nor Katreen
knew of it, a watch was set upon Achanna.
</p>

<p>
It could not be long before their secret was discovered,
and it was with a savage joy overmastering his sullen rage
that Ian Macarthur knew himself the discoverer, and
conceived his double vengeance.  He dreamed, gloatingly, on
both the black thoughts that roamed like ravenous beasts
through the solitudes of his heart.  But he did not dream
that another man was filled with hate because of Katreen's
lover, another man who had sworn to make her his own,
the man who, disguised, was known in Armadale as Donald
McLean, and in the north isles would have been hailed as
Gloom Achanna.
</p>

<p>
There had been steady rain for three days, with a cold,
raw wind.  On the fourth the sun shone, and set in peace.
An evening of quiet beauty followed, warm, fragrant, dusky
from the absence of moon or star, though the thin veils of
mist promised to disperse as the night grew.
</p>

<p>
There were two men that eve in the undergrowth on the
south side of the lochlet.  Sheumais had come earlier than
his wont.  Impatient for the dusk, he could scarce await the
waning of the afterglow; surely, he thought, he might
venture.  Suddenly his ears caught the sound of cautious
footsteps.  Could it be old Donald, perhaps with some inkling
of the way in which his daughter saw her lover in despite
of all; or, mayhap, might it be Ian Macarthur, tracking him
as a hunter stalking a stag by the water-pools?  He crouched,
and waited.  In a few minutes he saw Ian carefully picking
his way.  The man stooped as he descried the green branches;
smiled as, with a low rustling, he raised them from the
ground.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile yet another man watched and waited, though
on the further side of the lochan, where the hazel copses
were.  Gloom Achanna half hoped, half feared the approach
of Katreen.  It would be sweet to see her again, sweet to
slay her lover before her eyes, brother to him though he
was.  But, there was the chance that she might descry him,
and, whether recognizingly or not, warn the swimmer.
</p>

<p>
So it was that he had come there before sundown, and
now lay crouched among the bracken underneath a projecting
mossy ledge close upon the water, where it could scarce
be that she or any should see him.
</p>

<p>
As the gloaming deepened a great stillness reigned.
There was no breath of wind.  A scarce audible sigh
prevailed among the spires of the heather.  The churring of a
night-jar throbbed through the darkness.  Somewhere a
corncrake called its monotonous crek-craik; the dull, harsh
sound emphasizing the utter stillness.  The pinging of the
gnats hovering over and among the sedges made an incessant
murmur through the warm, sultry air.
</p>

<p>
There was a splash once as of a fish.  Then, silence.
Then a lower but more continuous splash, or rather wash
of water.  A slow susurrus rustled through the dark.
</p>

<p>
Where he lay among the fern Gloom Achanna slowly
raised his head, stared through the shadows and listened
intently.  If Katreen were waiting there she was not near.
</p>

<p>
Noiselessly he slid into the water.  When he rose it was
under a clump of green branches.  These he had cut and
secured three hours before.  With his left hand he swam
slowly, or kept his equipoise in the water; with his right he
guided the heavy rowan bough.  In his mouth were two
objects, one long and thin and dark, the other with an
occasional glitter as of a dead fish.
</p>

<p>
His motion was scarcely perceptible.  None the less he
was near the middle of the loch almost as soon as another
clump of green branches.  Doubtless the swimmer beneath
it was confident that he was now safe from observation.
</p>

<p>
The two clumps of green branches drew nearer.  The
smaller seemed a mere estray, a spray blown down by the
recent gale.  But all at once the larger clump jerked
awkwardly and stopped.  Simultaneously a strange, low strain
of music came from the other.
</p>

<p>
The strain ceased.  The two clumps of green branches
remained motionless.  Slowly, at last, the larger moved
forward.  It was too dark for the swimmer to see if any one
lay hid behind the smaller.  When he reached it he thrust
aside the leaves.
</p>

<p>
It was as though a great salmon leaped.  There was a
splash, and a narrow, dark body shot through the gloom.
At the end of it something gleamed.  Then suddenly there
was a savage struggle.  The inanimate green branches tore
this way and that, and surged and swirled.  Gasping cries
came from the leaves.  Again and again the gleaming thing
leaped.  At the third leap an awful scream shrilled through
the silence.  The echo of it wailed thrice, with horrible
distinctness, in the corrie beyond Cnoc-an-Fhraoch.  Then,
after a faint splashing, there was silence once more.  One
clump of green branches drifted slowly up the lochlet.  The
other moved steadily toward the place whence, a brief while
before, it had stirred.
</p>

<p>
Only one thing lived in the heart of Gloom Achanna&mdash;the
joy of his exultation.  He had killed his brother Sheumais.
He had always hated him because of his beauty; of
late he had hated him because he had stood between him,
Gloom, and Katreen Macarthur&mdash;because he had become her
lover.  They were all dead now except himself, all the
Achannas.  He was "Achanna."  When the day came that
he would go back to Galloway, there would be a magpie on
the first birk, and a screaming jay on the first rowan, and
a croaking raven on the first fir; ay, he would be their
suffering, though they knew nothing of him meanwhile!  He
would be Achanna of Achanna again.  Let those who would
stand in his way beware.  As for Katreen: perhaps he
would take her there, perhaps not.  He smiled.
</p>

<p>
These thoughts were the wandering fires in his brain
while he slowly swam shoreward under the floating green
branches, and as he disengaged himself from them and
crawled upward through the bracken.  It was at this
moment that a third man entered the water from the further
shore.
</p>

<p>
Prepared as he was to come suddenly upon Katreen,
Gloom was startled when, in a place of dense shadow, a
hand touched his shoulder, and her voice whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Sheumais, Sheumais!"
</p>

<p>
The next moment she was in his arms.  He could feel
her heart beating against his side.
</p>

<p>
"What was it, Sheumais?  What was that awful cry?"
she whispered.
</p>

<p>
For answer he put his lips to hers, and kissed her again
and again.
</p>

<p>
The girl drew back.  Some vague instinct warned her.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Sheumais?  Why don't you speak?"
</p>

<p>
He drew her close again.
</p>

<p>
"Pulse of my heart, it is I who love you, I who love you
best of all; it is I, Gloom Achanna!"
</p>

<p>
With a cry she struck him full in the face.  He staggered,
and in that moment she freed herself.
</p>

<p>
"You <i>coward</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Katreen, I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Come no nearer.  If you do, it will be the death of
you!"
</p>

<p>
"The death o' me!  Ah, bonnie fool that you are, and
is it you that will be the death o' me?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Gloom Achanna, for I have but to scream and
Sheumais will be here, an' he would kill you like a dog
if he knew you did me harm."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but if there were no Sheumais, or any man to come
between me an' my will!"
</p>

<p>
"Then there would be a woman!  Ay, if you overbore
me I would strangle you with my hair, or fix my teeth in
your false throat!"
</p>

<p>
"I was not for knowing you were such a wild-cat; but
I'll tame you yet, my lass!  Aha, wild-cat!"  And as he
spoke he laughed low.
</p>

<p>
"It is a true word, Gloom of the black heart.  I am
a wild-cat, and, like a wild-cat, I am not to be seized by a
fox; and that you will be finding to your cost, by the holy
St. Bridget!  But now, off with you, brother of my man!"
</p>

<p>
"Your man&mdash;ha! ha!"
</p>

<p>
"Why do you laugh?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure, I am laughing at a warm, white lass like yourself
having a dead man as your lover!"
</p>

<p>
"A&mdash;dead&mdash;man?"
</p>

<p>
No answer came.  The girl shook with a new fear.
Slowly she drew closer, till her breath fell warm against the
face of the other.  He spoke at last:
</p>

<p>
"Ay, a dead man."
</p>

<p>
"It is a lie."
</p>

<p>
"Where would you be that you were not hearing his
good-by?  I'm thinking it was loud enough!"
</p>

<p>
"It is a lie&mdash;it is a lie!"
</p>

<p>
"No, it is no lie.  Sheumais is cold enough now.  He's
low among the weeds by now.  Ay, by now: down there in
the lochan."
</p>

<p>
"<i>What</i>&mdash;you, <i>you devil</i>!  Is it for killing your own
brother you would be?"
</p>

<p>
"I killed no one.  He died his own way.  Maybe the
cramp took him.  Maybe&mdash;maybe a kelpie gripped him.  I
watched.  I saw him beneath the green branches.  He was
dead before he died.  I saw it in the white face o' him.
Then he sank.  He's dead.  Sheumais is dead.  Look here,
girl, I've always loved you.  I swore the oath upon you.
You're mine.  Sure, you're mine now, Katreen!  It is
loving you I am!  It will be a south wind for you from this
day, muirnean mochree!  See here, I'll show you how I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Back&mdash;back&mdash;<i>murderer</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Be stopping that foolishness now, Katreen Macarthur!
By the Book, I am tired of it.  I am loving you, and it's
having you for mine I am!  And if you won't come to me
like the dove to its mate, I'll come to you like the hawk to
the dove!"
</p>

<p>
With a spring he was upon her.  In vain she strove to
beat him back.  His arms held her as a stoat grips a rabbit.
</p>

<p>
He pulled her head back, and kissed her throat till the
strangulating breath sobbed against his ear.  With a last
despairing effort she screamed the name of the dead man:
"<i>Sheumais!  Sheumais!  Sheumais!</i>"  The man who struggled
with her laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, call away!  The herrin' will be coming through the
bracken as soon as Sheumais comes to your call!  Ah, it is
mine you are now, Katreen!  He's dead and cold&mdash;an' you'd
best have a living man&mdash;an'&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She fell back, her balance lost in the sudden releasing.
What did it mean?  Gloom still stood there, but as one
frozen.  Through the darkness she saw, at last, that a hand
gripped his shoulder; behind him a black mass vaguely
obtruded.
</p>

<p>
For some moments there was absolute silence.  Then a
hoarse voice came out of the dark:
</p>

<p>
"You will be knowing now who it is, Gloom Achanna!"
</p>

<p>
The voice was that of Sheumais, who lay dead in the
lochan.  The murderer shook as in a palsy.  With a great
effort, slowly he turned his head.  He saw a white splatch,
the face of the corpse; in this white splatch flamed two
burning eyes, the eyes of the soul of the brother whom he
had slain.
</p>

<p>
He reeled, staggered as a blind man, and, free now of
that awful clasp, swayed to and fro as one drunken.
</p>

<p>
Slowly Sheumais raised an arm and pointed downward
through the wood toward the lochan.  Still pointing, he
moved swiftly forward.
</p>

<p>
With a cry like a beast, Gloom Achanna swung to one
side, stumbled, rose, and leaped into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
For some minutes Sheumais and Katreen stood, silent,
apart, listening to the crashing sound of his flight&mdash;the race
of the murderer against the pursuing shadow of the Grave.

A BEWITCHED SHIP
</p>

<p class="t3">
By W. CLARK RUSSELL
</p>

<p>
"About ten years ago," began my friend, Captain
Green, "I went as second mate of a ship named the
'Ocean King.'  She'd been an old Indiaman in her
time, and had a poop and topgallant forecastle,
though alterations had knocked some of the dignity out of
her.  Her channels had been changed into plates with
dead-eyes above the rail, and the eye missed the spread of the
lower rigging that it naturally sought in looking at a craft
with a square stern and windows in it, and checkered sides
rounding out into curves, that made a complete tub of the
old hooker.  Yet, spite of changes, the old-fashioned grace
would break through.  She looked like a lady who has seen
better days, who has got to do work which servants did for
her in the times when she was well off, but who, let her
set her hand to what she will, makes you see that the breeding
and the instincts are still there, and that she's as little
to be vulgarized by poverty and its coarse struggles as she
could be made a truer lady than she is by money.  Ships,
like human beings, have their careers, and the close of some
of them is strange, and sometimes hard, I think.
</p>

<p>
"The 'Ocean King' had been turned into a collier, and
I went second mate of her when she was full up with coal
for a South African port.  Yet, this ship, that was now
carrying one of the dirtiest cargoes you could name, barring
phosphate manure, had been reckoned in her day a fine
passenger vessel, a noble Indiaman indeed&mdash;her tonnage was
something over eleven hundred&mdash;with a cuddy fitted up
royally.  Many a freight of soldiers had she carried round the
Cape, many an old nabob had she conveyed&mdash;ay, and Indian
potentates, who smoked out of jeweled hookahs, and who
were waited upon by crowds of black servants in turbans
and slippers.  I used to moralize over her just as I would
over a tomb, when I had the watch and was alone and
could let my thoughts run loose.
</p>

<p>
"The sumptuous cabin trappings were all gone, and I
seemed to smell coal in the wind, even when my head was
over the weather side, and when the breeze that blew along
came fresh across a thousand miles of sea; but there was a
good deal of the fittings left&mdash;fittings which, I don't doubt,
made the newspapers give a long account of this 'fine, great
ship' when she was launched&mdash;quite enough of them to enable
a man to reconstruct a picture of the cuddy of the 'Ocean
King' as it was in the days of her glory, when the soft
oil-lamps shone bright on the draped tables and sparkled on
silver and glass; when the old skipper, sitting with the
mizzenmast behind him, would look, with his red face and white
hair, down the rows of ladies and gentlemen eating and
drinking, stewards running about, trays hanging from the deck
above, and globes full of gold-fish swinging to the roll of
the vessel as she swung stately, with her stunsails hanging
out, over the long blue swell, wrinkled by the wind.  The
ship is still afloat.  Where are the people she carried?  The
crews who have worked her?  The captains who have commanded
her?  There is nothing that should be fuller of
ghosts than an old ship; and I very well remember that
when I first visited the 'Victory,' at Portsmouth, and
descended into her cockpit, what I saw was not a well-preserved
and cleanly length of massive deck, but groups of
wounded and bleeding and dying men littering the dark
floor, and the hatchway shadowed by groaning figures
handed below, while the smell of English, French, and
Spanish gunpowder, even down there, was so strong&mdash;phew!  I
could have spat the flavor out!
</p>

<p>
"Well, the old 'Ocean King' had once upon a time been
said to be haunted.  She had certainly been long enough
afloat to own a hundred stories, and she was so stanch and
true that if ever a superstition got into her there was no
chance of its getting out again.  I only remember one of
these yarns; it was told to me by the dockmaster, who had
been at sea for many years, was an old man, and knew the
history of all such craft as the 'Ocean King.'  He said that,
in '51, I think it was, there had been a row among the crew:
an Italian sailor stabbed an Englishman, who bled to death.
To avenge the Englishman's death the rest of the crew, who
were chiefly English, thrust the Italian into the forepeak
and let him lie there in darkness.  When he was asked for
they reported that he had fallen overboard, and this seems
to have been believed.  Whether the crew meant to starve
him or not is not certain; but, after he had been in the
forepeak three or four days, a fellow going behind the galley
out of the way of the wind to light his pipe&mdash;it being then
four bells in the first watch&mdash;came running into the forecastle,
with his hair on end, and the sweat pouring off his face,
swearing he had seen the Italian's ghost.  This frightened
the men prettily; some of them went down into the forepeak,
and found the Italian lying there dead, with a score of rats
upon him, which scampered off when the men dropped below.
During all the rest of the voyage his ghost was constantly
seen, sometimes at the lee wheel, sometimes astride of the
flying-jibboom.  What was the end of it&mdash;I mean, whether
the men confessed the murder, and, if so, what became of
them&mdash;the dockmaster said he didn't know.  But, be this
as it may, I discovered shortly after we had begun our voyage
that the crew had got to hear of this story, and the chief mate
said it had been brought aboard by the carpenter, who had
picked it up from some of the dockyard laborers.
</p>

<p>
"I well recollect two uncomfortable circumstances; we
sailed on a Friday, and the able and ordinary seamen were
thirteen in number, the idlers and ourselves aft bringing up
the ship's company to nineteen souls! when, I suppose, in
her prime the 'Ocean King' never left port short of seventy
or eighty seamen, not to mention stewards, cooks, cooks'
mates, butcher, butcher's mate, baker, and the rest of them.
But double topsail yards were now in; besides, I understood
that the vessel's masts had been reduced and her yards
shortened, and we carried stump fore and mizzen-topgallant
masts.
</p>

<p>
"All being ready, a tug got hold of our tow-rope, and away
we went down the river and out to sea.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe myself that any stories which had been
told the men about the ship impressed them much.  Sailors
are very superstitious, but they are not to be scared till
something has happened to frighten them.  Your merely
telling them that there's a ghost aboard the ship they're in
won't alarm them till they've caught sight of the ghost.  But
once let a man say to the others: 'There's a bloomin' sperrit
in this ship.  Lay your head agin the forehatch, and you'll
hear him gnashing his teeth and rattlin' his chains,' and then
let another man go and listen, and swear, and perhaps very
honestly, that he 'heerd the noises plain,' and you'll have all
hands in a funk, talking in whispers, and going aloft in the
dark nervously.
</p>

<p>
"In our ship nothing happened for some days.  We were
deep and slow, and rolled along solemnly, the sea falling
away from the vessel's powerful round bows as from a rock.
Pile what we could upon her, with tacks aboard, staysails
drawing, and the wind hitting her best sailing point, we could
seldom manage to get more than seven knots out of her.
One night I had the first watch.  It was about two bells.
There was a nice wind, sea smooth, and a red moon crawling
up over our starboard beam.  We were under all plain sail,
leaning away from the wind a trifle, and the water washed
along under the bends in lines through which the starlight
ran glimmering.
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking over the five or six months' voyages
which old wagons after the pattern of this ship took in
getting to India, when, seeing a squall coming along, I sung out
for hands to stand by the main-royal and mizzen-topgallant
halliards.  It drove down dark, and not knowing what was
behind I ordered the main-royal to be clewed up and furled.
Two youngsters went aloft.  By the time they were on the
yard the squall thinned, but I fancied there was another
bearing down, and thought it best to let the ordinary seamen
roll the sail up.  On a sudden down they both trotted, hand
over hand, leaving the sail flapping in the clutch of the
clew-lines.
</p>

<p>
"I roared out: 'What d'ye mean by coming down before
you've furled that sail?'
</p>

<p>
"They stood together in the main rigging, and one of
them answered: 'Please, sir, there's a ghost somewhere up
aloft on the foretopsail-yard.'
</p>

<p>
"'A ghost, you fool!' I cried.
</p>

<p>
"'Yes, sir,' he answered.  'He says: "Jim, your mother
wants yer."  I says: "What?" and he says: "Your mother
wants yer," in the hollowest o' voices.  Dick here heard it.
There's no one aloft forrard, sir.'
</p>

<p>
"I sung out to them to jump aloft again, and finding that
they didn't move I made a spring, on which they dropped
like lightning on deck, and began to beg and pray of me in
the eagerest manner not to send them aloft, as they were
too frightened to hold on.  Indeed, the fellow named Jim
actually began to shiver and cry when I threatened him; so
as the royal had to be furled I sent an able seaman aloft,
who, after rolling up the sail, came down and said that no
voice had called to him, and that he rather reckoned it was
a bit of skylarking on the part of the boys to get out of
stowing the sail.  However, I noticed that the man was
wonderfully quick over the job, and that afterward the watch
on deck stood talking in low voices in the waist.
</p>

<p>
"Jim was a fool of a youth, but Dick was a smart lad, aged
about nineteen, and good-looking, with a lively tongue, and
I heard afterward that he could spin a yarn to perfection all
out of his imagination.  I called him to me, and asked him if
he had really heard a voice, and he swore he had.
</p>

<p>
"'Did it say,' said I, 'Jim, your mother wants you?'
</p>

<p>
"'Ay, sir,' he answered, with a bit of a shudder, 'as plain
as you yourself say it.  It seemed to come off the foretop-gallant
yard, where I fancied I see something dark a-moving,
but I was too frightened to take particular notice.'
</p>

<p>
"Well, it was not long after this, about eleven o'clock in
the morning, that, the captain being on deck, the cook steps
out of the galley, comes walking along the poop, and going
up to the skipper touches his cap, and stands looking at him.
</p>

<p>
"'What d'ye want?' said the captain, eying him as if he
took him to be mad.
</p>

<p>
"'Didn't you call, sir?' says the cook.
</p>

<p>
"'Call!' cries the skipper.  'Certainly not.'
</p>

<p>
"The man looked stupid with surprise, and, muttering
something to himself, went forward.  Ten minutes after he
came up again to the skipper, and says: 'Yes, sir!' as a man
might who answers to a call.  The skipper began to swear
at him, and called him a lunatic, and so on; but the man,
finding he was wrong again, grew white, and swore that if
he was on his death-bed he'd maintain that the captain had
called him twice.
</p>

<p>
"The skipper, who was a rather nervous man, turned to
me, and said: 'What do you make of this, Mr. Green?  I can't
doubt the cook's word.  Who's calling him in my voice?'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, it's some illusion, sir,' said I, feeling puzzled for
all that.
</p>

<p>
"But the cook, with the tears actually standing in his
eyes, declared it was no illusion; he'd know the captain's
voice if it was nine miles off.  And he then walked in a
dazed way toward the forecastle, singing out that whether
the voice he had heard belonged to a ghost or a Christian
man, it might go on calling 'Cook!' for the next twenty
years without his taking further notice of it.  This thing,
coming so soon after the call to Jim that had so greatly
alarmed the two ordinary seamen, made a great impression
on the crew; and I never regret anything more than that
my position should have prevented me from getting into
their confidence, and learning their thoughts, for there is
no doubt I should have stowed away memories enough to
serve me for many a hearty laugh in after years.
</p>

<p>
"A few days rolled by without anything particular
happening.  One night it came to my turn to have the first
watch.  It was a quiet night, with wind enough to keep the
sails still while the old ship went drowsily rolling along her
course to the African port.  Suddenly I heard a commotion
forward, and fearing that some accident had happened, I
called out to know what the matter was.  A voice answered:
'Ghost or no ghost, there's somebody a-talking in the
forehold; come and listen, sir.'  The silence that followed
suggested a good deal of alarm.  I sang out as I approached the
men, 'Perhaps there's a stowaway below.'
</p>

<p>
"'It's no living voice,' was the reply; 'it sounds as if it
comes from a skelington.'
</p>

<p>
"I found a crowd of men standing in awed postures near
the hatch, and the most frightened of all looked to me to be
the ordinary seaman Dick, who had backed away on the
other side of the hatch, and stood looking on, leaning with
his hands on his knees, and staring as if he were fascinated.
I waited a couple or three minutes, which, in a business of
this kind, seems a long time, and, hearing nothing, I was
going to ridicule the men for their nervousness, when a
hollow voice under the hatch said distinctly, 'It's a terrible
thing to be a ghost and not be able to get out.'
</p>

<p>
"I was greatly startled, and ran aft to tell the captain,
who agreed with me that there must be a stowaway in the
hold, and that he had gone mad.  We both went forward,
and the hatch was lifted, and we looked on top of the coal;
and I was then about to ask some of the men to join me
in a search in the forepeak, for upon my word I had no
taste single-handed for a job of that kind at such a
moment, when the voice said, 'There's no use looking, you'll
never find me.  I'm not to be seen.'
</p>

<p>
"'Confound me!' cried the skipper, polishing his forehead
with a pocket-handkerchief, 'if ever I heard of such
a thing.  I'll tell you what it is,' he shouted, looking into
the hatch, 'dead men can't talk, and so, as you're bound to
be alive, you'd better come up out of that, and smartly
too&mdash;d'ye hear?&mdash;or you'll find this the worst attempt at
skylarking that was ever made.'
</p>

<p>
"There was a short silence, and you'd see all hands straining
their ears, for there was light enough for that, given out
by a lantern one of the men held.
</p>

<p>
"'You couldn't catch me because you couldn't see me,'
said the voice in a die-away tone, and this time it came from
the direction of the main hatch, as though it had flitted aft.
</p>

<p>
"'Well,' says the captain, 'may I be jiggered!' and
without another word he walked away on to the poop.
</p>

<p>
"I told the men to clap the hatches on again, and they
did this in double-quick time, evidently afraid that the
ghost might pop up out of the hold if they didn't mind
their eye.
</p>

<p>
"All this made us very superstitious, from the captain
down to the boys.  We talked it over in the cabin, and the
mate was incredulous, and disposed to ridicule me.
</p>

<p>
"'Any way,' said he, 'it's strange that this voice is only
heard in your watch.  It's never favored me with any
remarks.  The creaking and groaning of an old wooden ship
is often like spoken words, and what you've been hearing
may be nothing but a deception of the ear.'
</p>

<p>
"'A deception in your eye,' cried the skipper.  'The
timbers of an old wooden ship may strain and creak in the
Dutch language, but hang me if they ever talked good,
sensible English.  However, I'm not going to worry.  For my
part,' said he, with a nervous glance around him, 'I don't
believe in ghosts; whatever it is that's talking in the hold
may go on jawing, so long as he sticks to that, and don't
frighten the men with an ugly mug, nor come upon us for
a man's allowance.'
</p>

<p>
"'If it's anybody's ghost,' said I, 'it must be the Italian's,
the chap that was starved in the forepeak.'
</p>

<p>
"'I doubt that,' said the skipper.  'I didn't detect
anything foreign in what he said.  To my ear it sounded more
like Whitechapel than Italiano.'
</p>

<p>
"Well, for another week we heard little more of the
ghost.  It's true that one middle watch a chap I had sent
aloft to loose the main-royal had hardly stepped out of the
lower rigging, after lingering in the crosstrees to overhaul
his clew-lines, when he comes rushing up to me and cries
out, 'I've been hailed from aloft, sir! a voice has just sung
out, "Tommy, jump aloft again that I may have a good
look at you!"'
</p>

<p>
"'Who's up there?' I asked him, staring into the gloom
where the mast and yards went towering.
</p>

<p>
"'There's no one up there, sir; I'll swear it.  I was
bound to see him had any one been there,' he answered,
evidently very much frightened.
</p>

<p>
"It occurred to me that some one of the crew might be
lying hid in the top, and that if I could catch him I might
find out who the ghost was.  So I jumped into the rigging
and trotted aloft, keeping my eye on the lee rigging, to
make sure that no one descended by it.  I gained the top,
but nobody was there.  I mounted to the crosstrees, but the
deuce a sign of any one could I see.  I came down, feeling
both foolish and scared; for you see I had heard the voice
myself in the hold; there was no question that there was
a voice, belonging to nobody knew what, knocking about
the ship, and consequently it was now impossible to help
believing a man when he said he heard it.
</p>

<p>
"However, it was necessary to keep the men in heart, and
this was not to be done by captain and mates appearing
scared; so I reasoned a bit with the man, told him that
there were no such things as ghosts, that a voice was bound
to come from a live person, because a spectre couldn't
possibly have lungs, those organs being of a perishable nature,
and then sent him forward, but no easier in his mind, I
suspect, than I was.  Anyhow, I was glad when eight bells
struck and it was my turn to go below.  But, as I have said,
nothing much came of this&mdash;at least, nothing that reached
my ears.  But not many nights following the ship lay
becalmed&mdash;there wasn't a breath of air, and the sea lay smooth
as polished jet.  This time I had the middle watch again.
I was walking quietly up and down the poop, on the
lookout for a deeper shadow upon the sea to indicate
the approach of wind, when a man came up the ladder
and said, 'There's some one a-talking to the ship under
the bows.'
</p>

<p>
"'Are you awake?' said I.
</p>

<p>
"'Heaven help me, as I stand here, sir,' exclaimed the
fellow, solemnly, 'if that there woice which talked in the
hold t'other day ain't now over the side.'
</p>

<p>
"I ran forward, and found most of the watch huddled
together near the starboard cathead.  I peered over, and
there was a dead silence.
</p>

<p>
"'What are you looking over that side for?  I'm here!'
said a thin, faint voice, that seemed more in the air than in
the sea.
</p>

<p>
"There!' exclaimed one of the seamen, in a hoarse
whisper, 'that's the third time.  Whichever side we look, he's
on the other.'
</p>

<p>
"'But there must be some one in the water,' said another
man.  'Anybody see his houtline? cuss me if I couldn't
swear I see a chap swimmin' just now.'
</p>

<p>
"'No, no,' answered some one, gruffly, 'nothing but phosphorus,
Joe, and the right sort o' stuff, too, for if this ain't
old Nick&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'You're a liar, Sam!' came the voice clear, and, as one
could swear, plain from over the side.
</p>

<p>
"There was a general recoil, and a sort of groan ran
among the men.
</p>

<p>
"At the same moment I collared a figure standing near
me, and slued him round to bring his face fair to the
starlight, clear of the staysail.  'Come you along with me,
Master Dick,' said I; and I marched him off the forecastle, along
the main deck, and up on to the poop.  'So <i>you're</i> the ghost,
eh?' said I.  'Why, to have kept your secret you should have
given my elbow a wider berth.  No wonder the voice only
makes observations in my watch.  You're too lazy, I
suppose, to leave your hammock to try your wonderful power
on the mate, eh?  Now see here,' said I, finding him silent,
and noticing how white his face glimmered to the stars, 'I
know you're the man, so you'd better confess.  Own the
truth and I'll keep your secret, providing you belay all
further tricks of the same kind; deny that you're the ghost
and I'll speak to the captain and set the men upon you.'
</p>

<p>
"This fairly frightened him.  'Well, sir, it's true; I'm the
voice, sir; but for God's sake keep the secret, sir.  The men
'ud have my life if they found out that it was me as scared
them.'
</p>

<p>
"This confession was what I needed, for though when
standing pretty close to him on the forecastle I could have
sworn that it was he who uttered the words which perplexed
and awed the sailors, yet so perfect was the deception,
so fine, in short, was his skill as a ventriloquist that,
had he stoutly denied and gone on denying that he was the
'voice,' I should have believed him and continued sharing
in the wonder and superstition of the crew.  I kept his secret
as I promised; but, somehow or other, it leaked out in time
that he could deceive the ear by apparently pitching his
voice among the rigging, or under the deck, or over the side,
though the discovery was not made until the 'ghost' had
for a long time ceased to trouble the ship's company, and
until the men's superstitious awe had faded somewhat, and
they had recovered their old cheerfulness.  We then sent
for Dick to the cabin, where he gave us a real entertainment
as a ventriloquist, imitating all sorts of animals, and
producing sounds as of women in distress and men singing
out for help, in the berths; indeed, such was the skill that
I'd often see the skipper and mate turning startled to look
in the direction whence the voices proceeded.
</p>

<p>
"He made his peace with the men by amusing them in
the same way; so that, instead of getting the rope's ending
aft and the pummeling forward which he deserved, he ended
as a real and general favorite, and one of the most amusing
fellows that a man ever was shipmate with.  I used to tell
him that if he chose to perform ashore, he was sure to
make plenty of money, since such ventriloquial powers as
his was the rarest thing in the world; and I'd sometimes
fancy he meant to take my advice.  But whether he died or
kept on going to sea I don't know, for after he left the ship
I never saw nor heard of him again."

<i>Charles Dickens (born 1812, died 1870) has

fiction is a recognized trade or art, who is not,
whether he knows it and owns it, or no, largely
influenced by Dickens."</i>

THE SIGNAL-MAN
</p>

<p class="t3">
By CHARLES DICKENS
</p>

<p>
"Halloa!  Below there!"
</p>

<p>
When he heard a voice thus calling to him, he
was standing at the door of his box, with a flag
in his hand, furled round its short pole.  One
would have thought, considering the nature of the ground,
that he could not have doubted from what quarter the voice
came; but instead of looking up to where I stood on the
top of the steep cutting nearly over his head, he turned
himself about, and looked down the Line.  There was something
remarkable in his manner of doing so, though I could
not have said for my life what.  But I know it was remarkable
enough to attract my notice, even though his figure
was foreshortened and shadowed, down in the deep trench,
and mine was high above him, so steeped in the glow of
an angry sunset that I had shaded my eyes with my hand
before I saw him at all.
</p>

<p>
"Halloa!  Below!"
</p>

<p>
From looking down the Line, he turned himself about
again, and, raising his eyes, saw my figure high above him.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any path by which I can come down and speak
to you?"
</p>

<p>
He looked up at me without replying, and I
at him without pressing him too soon with a repetition of
my idle question.  Just then there came a vague vibration
in the earth and air, quickly changing into a violent
pulsation, and an oncoming rush that caused me to start back,
as though it had force to draw me down.  When such vapor
as rose to my height from this rapid train had passed me,
and was skimming away over the landscape, I looked down
again, and saw him refurling the flag he had shown while
the train went by.
</p>

<p>
I repeated my inquiry.  After a pause, during which he
seemed to regard me with fixed attention, he motioned with
his rolled-up flag toward a point on my level, some two or
three hundred yards distant.  I called down to him, "All
right!" and made for that point.  There, by dint of looking
closely about me, I found a rough zigzag descending path
notched out, which I followed.
</p>

<p>
The cutting was extremely deep, and unusually precipitate.
It was made through a clammy stone, that became
oozier and wetter as I went down.  For these reasons, I
found the way long enough to give me time to recall a
singular air of reluctance or compulsion with which he had
pointed out the path.
</p>

<p>
When I came down low enough upon the zigzag descent
to see him again, I saw that he was standing between the
rails on the way by which the train had lately passed, in an
attitude as if he were waiting for me to appear.  He had
his left hand at his chin, and that left elbow rested on his
right hand, crossed over his breast.  His attitude was one
of such expectation and watchfulness that I stopped a
moment, wondering at it.
</p>

<p>
I resumed my downward way, and stepping out upon the
level of the railroad, and drawing nearer to him, saw that
he was a dark, sallow man, with a dark beard and rather
heavy eyebrows.  His post was in as solitary and dismal a
place as ever I saw.  On either side, a dripping-wet wall
of jagged stone, excluding all view but a strip of sky; the
perspective one way only a crooked prolongation of this
great dungeon; the shorter perspective in the other
direction terminating in a gloomy red light, and the gloomier
entrance to a black tunnel, in whose massive architecture
there was a barbarous, depressing, and forbidding air.  So
little sunlight ever found its way to this spot that it had an
earthy, deadly smell; and so much cold wind rushed through
it that it struck chill to me, as if I had left the natural
world.
</p>

<p>
Before he stirred, I was near enough to him to have
touched him.  Not even then removing his eyes from mine,
he stepped back one step, and lifted his hand.
</p>

<p>
This was a lonesome post to occupy (I said), and it had
riveted my attention when I looked down from up yonder.
A visitor was a rarity, I should suppose; not an unwelcome
rarity, I hoped?  In me, he merely saw a man who had been
shut up within narrow limits all his life, and who, being at
last set free, had a newly-awakened interest in these great
works.  To such purpose I spoke to him; but I am far from
sure of the terms I used; for, besides that I am not happy in
opening any conversation, there was something in the man
that daunted me.
</p>

<p>
He directed a most curious look toward the red light
near the tunnel's mouth, and looked all about it, as if
something were missing from it, and then looked at me.
</p>

<p>
That light was part of his charge?  Was it not?
</p>

<p>
He answered in a low voice: "Don't you know it is?"
</p>

<p>
The monstrous thought came into my mind, as I perused
the fixed eyes and the saturnine face, that this was a spirit,
not a man.  I have speculated since, whether there may have
been infection in his mind.
</p>

<p>
In my turn, I stepped back.  But in making the action,
I detected in his eyes some latent fear of me.  This put
the monstrous thought to flight.
</p>

<p>
"You look at me," I said, forcing a smile, "as if you had
a dread of me."
</p>

<p>
"I was doubtful," he returned, "whether I had seen you
before."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
He pointed to the red light he had looked at.
</p>

<p>
"There?" I said.
</p>

<p>
Intently watchful of me, he replied (but without sound),
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"My good fellow, what should I do there?  However, be
that as it may, I never was there, you may swear."
</p>

<p>
"I think I may," he rejoined.  "Yes; I am sure I may,"
</p>

<p>
His manner cleared, like my own.  He replied to my
remarks with readiness, and in well-chosen words.  Had he
much to do there?  Yes; that was to say, he had enough
responsibility to bear; but exactness and watchfulness were
what was required of him, and of actual work&mdash;manual
labor&mdash;he had next to none.  To change that signal, to trim
those lights, and to turn this iron handle now and then, was
all he had to do under that head.  Regarding those many
long and lonely hours of which I seemed to make so much,
he could only say that the routine of his life had shaped
itself into that form, and he had grown used to it.  He had
taught himself a language down here&mdash;if only to know by
sight, and to have formed his own crude ideas of its
pronunciation, could be called learning it.  He had also worked
at fractions and decimals, and tried a little algebra; but
he was, and had been as a boy, a poor hand at figures.  Was
it necessary for him when on duty always to remain in that
channel of damp air, and could he never rise into the
sunshine from between those high stone walls?  Why, that
depended upon times and circumstances.  Under some
conditions there would be less upon the Line than under others,
and the same held good as to certain hours of the day and
night.  In bright weather, he did choose occasions for
getting a little above these lower shadows; but, being at all
times liable to be called by his electric bell, and at such
times listening for it with redoubled anxiety, the relief was
less than I would suppose.
</p>

<p>
He took me into his box, where there was a fire, a desk
for an official book in which he had to make certain entries,
a telegraphic instrument with its dial, face, and needles, and
the little bell of which he had spoken.  On my trusting
that he would excuse the remark that he had been well
educated, and (I hoped I might say without offense), perhaps
educated above that station, he observed that instances of
slight incongruity in such wise would rarely be found
wanting among large bodies of men; that he had heard it was
so in workhouses, in the police force, even in that last
desperate resource, the army; and that he knew it was so, more
or less, in any great railway staff.  He had been, when young
(if I could believe it, sitting in that hut&mdash;he scarcely could),
a student of natural philosophy, and had attended lectures;
but he had run wild, misused his opportunities, gone down,
and never risen again.  He had no complaint to offer about
that.  He had made his bed, and he lay upon it.  It was far
too late to make another.
</p>

<p>
All that I have here condensed he said in a quiet manner,
with his grave dark regards divided between me and
the fire.  He threw in the word, "Sir," from time to time,
and especially when he referred to his youth&mdash;as though to
request me to understand that he claimed to be nothing but
what I found him.  He was several times interrupted by the
little bell, and had to read off messages, and send replies.
Once he had to stand without the door, and display a flag
as a train passed, and make some verbal communication to
the driver.  In the discharge of his duties, I observed him
to be remarkably exact and vigilant, breaking off his
discourse at a syllable, and remaining silent until what he
had to do was done.
</p>

<p>
In a word, I should have set this man down as one of the
safest of men to be employed in that capacity, but for the
circumstance that while he was speaking to me he twice
broke off with a fallen color, turned his face toward the
little bell when it did not ring, opened the door of the hut
(which was kept shut to exclude the unhealthy damp), and
looked out toward the red light near the mouth of the
tunnel.  On both of those occasions, he came back to the
fire with the inexplicable air upon him which I had
remarked, without being able to define, when we were so
far asunder.
</p>

<p>
Said I, when I rose to leave him, "You almost make me
think that I have met with a contented man."
</p>

<p>
(I am afraid I must acknowledge that I said it to lead
him on.)
</p>

<p>
"I believe I used to be so," he rejoined, in the low voice
in which he had first spoken; "but I am troubled, sir, I am
troubled."
</p>

<p>
He would have recalled the words if he could.  He had
said them, however, and I took them up quickly.
</p>

<p>
"With what?  What is your trouble?"
</p>

<p>
"It is very difficult to impart, sir.  It is very, very difficult
to speak of.  If ever you make me another visit, I will
try to tell you."
</p>

<p>
"But I expressly intend to make you another visit.  Say,
when shall it be?"
</p>

<p>
"I go off early in the morning, and I shall be on again at
ten to-morrow night, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I will come at eleven."
</p>

<p>
He thanked me, and went out at the door with me.  "I'll
show my white light, sir," he said, in his peculiar low voice,
"till you have found the way up.  When you have found it,
don't call out!  And when you are at the top, don't call out!"
</p>

<p>
His manner seemed to make the place strike colder to
me, but I said no more than, "Very well."
</p>

<p>
"And when you come down to-morrow night, don't call
out!  Let me ask you a parting question.  What made you
cry, 'Halloa!  Below there!' to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Heaven knows," said I.  "I cried something to that
effect&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not to that effect, sir.  Those were the very words.  I
know them well."
</p>

<p>
"Admit those were the very words.  I said them, no
doubt, because I saw you below."
</p>

<p>
"For no other reason?"
</p>

<p>
"What other reason could I possibly have?"
</p>

<p>
"You had no feeling that they were conveyed to you in
any supernatural way?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
He wished me good-night, and held up his light.  I
walked by the side of the down Line of rails (with a very
disagreeable sensation of a train coming behind me) until I
found the path.  It was easier to mount than to descend, and
I got back to my inn without any adventure.
</p>

<p>
Punctual to my appointment, I placed my foot on the
first notch of the zigzag next night, as the distant clocks
were striking eleven.  He was waiting for me at the bottom,
with his white light on.  "I have not called out," I said, when
we came close together; "may I speak now?"
</p>

<p>
"By all means, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, then, and here's my hand."
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, sir, and here's mine."
</p>

<p>
With that we walked side by side to his box, entered it,
closed the door, and sat down by the fire.
</p>

<p>
"I have made up my mind, sir," he began, bending
forward as soon as we were seated, and speaking in a tone but
a little above a whisper, "that you shall not have to ask me
twice what troubles me.  I took you for some one else,
yesterday evening.  That troubles me."
</p>

<p>
"That mistake?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  That some one else."
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Like me?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I never saw the face.  The left arm is
across the face, and the right arm is waved&mdash;violently waved.
This way."
</p>

<p>
I followed his action with my eyes, and it was the action
of an arm gesticulating, with the utmost passion and
vehemence:
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake, clear the way!"
</p>

<p>
"One moonlight night," said the man, "I was sitting
here, when I heard a voice cry, 'Halloa!  Below there!'  I
started up, looked from that door, and saw this Some one
else standing by the red light near the tunnel, waving as I
just now showed you.  The voice seemed hoarse with shouting,
and it cried, 'Look out!  Look out!'  And then again,
'Halloa!  Below there!  Look out!'  I caught up my lamp,
turned it on red, and ran toward the figure, calling, 'What's
wrong?  What has happened?  Where?'  It stood just outside
the blackness of the tunnel.  I advanced so close upon
it that I wondered at its keeping the sleeve across its eyes.
I ran right up at it, and had my hand stretched out to pull
the sleeve away, when it was gone."
</p>

<p>
"Into the tunnel?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"No.  I ran on into the tunnel, five hundred yards.  I
stopped, and held my lamp above my head, and saw the figures
of the measured distance, and saw the wet stains stealing
down the walls and trickling through the arch.  I ran
out again faster than I had run in (for I had a mortal
abhorrence of the place upon me), and I looked all round the
red light with my own red light, and I went up the iron
ladder to the gallery atop of it, and I came down again, and
ran back here.  I telegraphed both ways, 'An alarm has been
given.  Is anything wrong?'  The answer came back, both
ways, 'All well.'"
</p>

<p>
Resisting the slow touch of a frozen finger tracing out
my spine, I showed him how that this figure must be a
deception of his sense of sight; and how that figures,
originating in disease of the delicate nerves that minister to the
functions of the eye, were known to have often troubled
patients, some of whom had become conscious of the nature
of their affliction, and had even proved it by experiments
upon themselves.  "As to an imaginary cry," said I, "do but
listen for a moment to the wind in this unnatural valley
while we speak so low, and to the wild harp it makes of the
telegraph wires."
</p>

<p>
That was all very well, he returned, after we had sat
listening for a while, and he ought to know something of the
wind and the wires&mdash;he who so often passed long winter
nights there, alone and watching.  But he would beg to
remark that he had not finished.
</p>

<p>
I asked his pardon, and he slowly added these words,
touching my arm:
</p>

<p>
"Within six hours after the Appearance, the memorable
accident on this Line happened, and within ten hours the
dead and wounded were brought along through the tunnel
over the spot where the figure had stood."
</p>

<p>
A disagreeable shudder crept over me, but I did my
best against it.  It was not to be denied, I rejoined, that this
was a remarkable coincidence, calculated deeply to impress
his mind.  But it was unquestionable that remarkable
coincidences did continually occur, and they must be taken
into account in dealing with such a subject.  Though to be
sure I must admit, I added (for I thought I saw that he was
going to bring the objection to bear upon me), men of
common sense did not allow much for coincidences in making
the ordinary calculations of life.
</p>

<p>
He again begged to remark that he had not finished.
</p>

<p>
I again begged his pardon for being betrayed into
interruptions.
</p>

<p>
"This," he said, again laying his hand upon my arm, and
glancing over his shoulder with hollow eyes, "was just a
year ago.  Six or seven months passed, and I had recovered
from the surprise and shock, when one morning, as the day
was breaking, I, standing at the door, looked toward the
red light, and saw the spectre again."  He stopped, with a
fixed look at me.
</p>

<p>
"Did it cry out?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  It was silent."
</p>

<p>
"Did it wave its arm?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  It leaned against the shaft of the light, with both
hands before the face.  Like this."
</p>

<p>
Once more I followed his action with my eyes.  It was
an action of mourning.  I have seen such an attitude in
stone figures on tombs.
</p>

<p>
"Did you go up to it?"
</p>

<p>
"I came in and sat down, partly to collect my thoughts,
partly because it had turned me faint.  When I went to the
door again, daylight was above me, and the ghost was gone."
</p>

<p>
"But nothing followed?  Nothing came of this?"
</p>

<p>
He touched me on the arm with his forefinger twice or
thrice, giving a ghastly nod each time.
</p>

<p>
"That very day, as a train came out of the tunnel, I
noticed, at a carriage window on my side, what looked like
a confusion of hands and heads, and something waved.  I
saw it just in time to signal the driver, Stop!  He shut off,
and put his brake on, but the train drifted past here a
hundred and fifty yards or more.  I ran after it, and, as I went
along, heard terrible screams and cries.  A beautiful young
lady had died instantaneously in one of the compartments,
and was brought in here, and laid down on this floor
between us."
</p>

<p>
Involuntarily I pushed my chair back, as I looked from
the boards at which he pointed to himself.
</p>

<p>
"True, sir.  True.  Precisely as it happened, so I tell it
you."
</p>

<p>
I could think of nothing to say, to any purpose, and my
mouth was very dry.  The wind and the wires took up the
story with a long lamenting wail.
</p>

<p>
He resumed.  "Now, sir, mark this, and judge how my
mind is troubled.  The spectre came back a week ago.
Ever since, it has been there, now and again, by fits and
starts."
</p>

<p>
"At the light?"
</p>

<p>
"At the Danger-light."
</p>

<p>
"What does it seem to do?"
</p>

<p>
He repeated, if possible with increased passion and vehemence,
that former gesticulation of, "For God's sake, clear
the way!"
</p>

<p>
Then he went on.  "I have no peace or rest for it.  It
calls to me, for many minutes together, in an agonized
manner, 'Below there!  Look out!  Look out!'  It stands waving
to me.  It rings my little bell&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I caught at that.
</p>

<p>
"Did it ring your bell yesterday evening when I was
here, and you went to the door?"
</p>

<p>
"Twice."
</p>

<p>
"Why, see," said I, "how your imagination misleads you.
My eyes were on the bell, and my ears were open to the bell,
and if I am a living man, it did not ring at those times.
No, nor at any other time, except when it was rung in the
natural course of physical things by the station
communicating with you."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.  "I have never made a mistake as to
that yet, sir.  I have never confused the spectre's ring with
the man's.  The ghost's ring is a strange vibration in the
bell that it derives from nothing else, and I have not
asserted that the bell stirs to the eye.  I don't wonder that
you failed to hear it.  But <i>I</i> heard it."
</p>

<p>
"And did the spectre seem to be there, when you looked
out?"
</p>

<p>
"It was there."
</p>

<p>
"Both times?"
</p>

<p>
He repeated firmly: "Both times."
</p>

<p>
"Will you come to the door with me, and look for it
now?"
</p>

<p>
He bit his under lip as though he were somewhat unwilling,
but arose.  I opened the door, and stood on the step,
while he stood in the doorway.  There was the Danger-light.
There was the dismal mouth of the tunnel.  There were the
high, wet stone walls of the cutting.  There were the stars
above them.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see it?" I asked him, taking particular note of
his face.  His eyes were prominent and strained, but not very
much more so, perhaps, than my own had been when I had
directed them earnestly toward the same spot.
</p>

<p>
"No," he answered.  "It is not there."
</p>

<p>
"Agreed," said I.
</p>

<p>
We went in again, shut the door, and resumed our seats.
I was thinking how best to improve this advantage, if it
might be called one, when he took up the conversation in
such a matter-of-course way, so assuming that there could
be no serious question of fact between us, that I felt myself
placed in the weakest of positions.
</p>

<p>
"By this time you will fully understand, sir," he said,
"that what troubles me so dreadfully is the question, What
does the spectre mean?"
</p>

<p>
I was not sure, I told him, that I did fully understand.
</p>

<p>
"What is its warning against?" he said, ruminating, with
his eyes on the fire, and only by times turning them on me.
"What is the danger?  Where is the danger?  There is
danger overhanging somewhere on the Line.  Some dreadful
calamity will happen.  It is not to be doubted this third
time, after what has gone before.  But surely this is a cruel
haunting of <i>me</i>.  What can I do?"
</p>

<p>
He pulled out his handkerchief, and wiped the drops from
his heated forehead.
</p>

<p>
"If I telegraph Danger, on either side of me, or on both,
I can give no reason for it," he went on, wiping the palms
of his hands.  "I should get into trouble, and do no good.
They would think I was mad.  This is the way it would
work&mdash;Message: 'Danger!  Take care!'  Answer: 'What
Danger?  Where?'  Message: 'Don't know.  But, for God's
sake, take care!'  They would displace me.  What else could
they do?"
</p>

<p>
His pain of mind was most pitiable to see.  It was the
mental torture of a conscientious man, oppressed beyond
endurance by an unintelligible responsibility involving life.
</p>

<p>
"When it first stood under the Danger-light," he went on,
putting his dark hair back from his head, and drawing his
hands outward across and across his temples in an extremity
of feverish distress, "why not tell me where that accident
was to happen&mdash;if it must happen?  Why not tell me how
it could be averted&mdash;if it could have been averted?  When
on its second coming it hid its face, why not tell me,
instead, 'She is going to die.  Let them keep her at home'?
If it came, on those two occasions, only to show me that
its warnings were true, and so to prepare me for the third,
why not warn me plainly now?  And I, Lord help me! a
mere poor signal-man on this solitary station!  Why not
go to somebody with credit to be believed, and power to act?"
</p>

<p>
When I saw him in this state, I saw that for the poor
man's sake, as well as for the public safety, what I had to
do for the time was to compose his mind.  Therefore, setting
aside all question of reality or unreality between us, I
represented to him that whoever thoroughly discharged his
duty must do well, and that at least it was his comfort that he
understood his duty, though he did not understand these
confounding Appearances.  In this effort I succeeded far
better than in the attempt to reason him out of his conviction.
He became calm; the occupations incidental to his post
as the night advanced began to make larger demands on his
attention: and I left him at two in the morning.  I had
offered to stay through the night, but he would not hear of it.
</p>

<p>
That I more than once looked back at the red light as I
ascended the pathway, that I did not like the red light, and
that I should have slept but poorly if my bed had been
under it, I see no reason to conceal.  Nor did I like the two
sequences of the accident and the dead girl.  I see no reason
to conceal that either.
</p>

<p>
But what ran most in my thoughts was the consideration
how ought I to act, having become the recipient of this
disclosure?  I had proved the man to be intelligent, vigilant,
painstaking, and exact; but how long might he remain so,
in his state of mind?  Though in a subordinate position,
still he held a most important trust, and would I (for
instance) like to stake my own life on the chances of his
continuing to execute it with precision?
</p>

<p>
Unable to overcome a feeling that there would be
something treacherous in my communicating what he had told
me to his superiors in the Company, without first being
plain with himself and proposing a middle course to him,
I ultimately resolved to offer to accompany him (otherwise
keeping his secret for the present) to the wisest medical
practitioner we could hear of in those parts, and to take his
opinion.  A change in his time of duty would come round
next night, he had apprised me, and he would be off an hour
or two after sunrise, and on again soon after sunset.  I had
appointed to return accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Next evening was a lovely evening, and I walked out early
to enjoy it.  The sun was not yet quite down when I
traversed the field-path near the top of the deep cutting.
I would extend my walk for an hour, I said to myself, half
an hour on and half an hour back, and it would then be
time to go to my signal-man's box.
</p>

<p>
Before pursuing my stroll, I stepped to the brink, and
mechanically looked down, from the point from which I
had first seen him.  I can not describe the thrill that seized
upon me, when, close at the mouth of the tunnel, I saw the
appearance of a man, with his left sleeve across his eyes,
passionately waving his right arm.
</p>

<p>
The nameless horror that oppressed me passed in a moment,
for in a moment I saw that this appearance of a man
was a man indeed, and that there was a little group of other
men, standing at a short distance, to whom he seemed to be
rehearsing the gesture he made.  The Danger-light was
not yet lighted.  Against its shaft, a little low hut, entirely
new to me, had been made of some wooden supports and
tarpaulin.  It looked no bigger than a bed.
</p>

<p>
With an irresistible sense that something was wrong&mdash;with
a flashing self-reproachful fear that fatal mischief had
come of my leaving the man there, and causing no one to be
sent to overlook or correct what he did&mdash;I descended the
notched path with all the speed I could make.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" I asked the men.
</p>

<p>
"Signal-man killed this morning, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Not the man belonging to that box?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Not the man I know?"
</p>

<p>
"You will recognize him, sir, if you knew him," said the
man who spoke for the others, solemnly uncovering his own
head, and raising an end of the tarpaulin, "for his face is
quite composed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how did this happen, how did this happen?" I asked,
turning from one to another as the hut closed in again.
</p>

<p>
"He was cut down by an engine, sir.  No man in England
knew his work better.  But somehow he was not clear of the
outer rail.  It was just at broad day.  He had struck the
light, and had the lamp in his hand.  As the engine came out
of the tunnel, his back was toward her, and she cut him
down.  That man drove her, and was showing how it
happened.  Show the gentleman, Tom."
</p>

<p>
The man, who wore a rough dark dress, stepped back to
his former place at the mouth of the tunnel.
</p>

<p>
"Coming round the curve in the tunnel, sir," he said, "I
saw him at the end, like as if I saw him down a
perspective-glass.  There was no time
to check speed, and I knew him
to be very careful.  As he didn't seem to take heed of the
whistle, I shut it off when we were running down upon him,
and called to him as loud as I could call."
</p>

<p>
"What did you say?"
</p>

<p>
"I said, 'Below there!  Look out!  Look out!  For God's
sake, clear the way!'"
</p>

<p>
I started.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! it was a dreadful time, sir.  I never left off calling
to him.  I put this arm before my eyes not to see, and I
waved this arm to the last; but it was no use."
</p>

<p class="thought">
. . . . . . . . . . . .
</p>

<p>
Without prolonging the narrative to dwell on any one of
its curious circumstances more than on any other, I may, in
closing it, point out the coincidence that the warning of the
engine-driver included, not only the words which the
unfortunate signal-man had repeated to me as haunting him,
but also the words which I myself&mdash;not he&mdash;had attached,
and that only in my own mind, to the gesticulation he
imitated.

THE FOUR-FIFTEEN EXPRESS
</p>

<p class="t3">
By AMELIA B. EDWARDS
</p>

<p>
The events which I am about to relate took place
between nine and ten years ago.  Sebastopol had
fallen in the early spring, the peace of Paris had
been concluded since March, our commercial relations
with the Russian Empire were but recently renewed;
and I, returning home after my first northward journey since
the war, was well pleased with the prospect of spending the
month of December under the hospitable and thoroughly
English roof of my excellent friend, Jonathan Jelf, Esq., of
Dumbleton Manor, Clayborough, East Anglia.  Traveling
in the interests of the well-known firm in which it is my lot
to be a junior partner, I had been called upon to visit not
only the capitals of Russia and Poland, but had found it
also necessary to pass some weeks among the trading ports
of the Baltic; whence it came that the year was already far
spent before I again set foot on English soil, and that,
instead of shooting pheasants with him, as I had hoped, in
October, I came to be my friend's guest during the more
genial Christmas-tide.
</p>

<p>
My voyage over, and a few days given up to business
in Liverpool and London, I hastened down to Clayborough
with all the delight of a schoolboy whose holidays are at
hand.  My way lay by the Great East Anglian line as far
as Clayborough station, where I was to be met by one of
the Dumbleton carriages and conveyed across the remaining
nine miles of country.  It was a foggy afternoon,
singularly warm for the 4th of December, and I had arranged
to leave London by the 4:15 express.  The early darkness of
winter had already closed in; the lamps were lighted in the
carriages; a clinging damp dimmed the windows, adhered
to the door-handles, and pervaded all the atmosphere; while
the gas-jets at the neighboring book-stand diffused a
luminous haze that only served to make the gloom of the
terminus more visible.  Having arrived some seven minutes
before the starting of the train, and, by the connivance of
the guard, taken sole possession of an empty compartment,
I lighted my traveling-lamp, made myself particularly snug,
and settled down to the undisturbed enjoyment of a book
and a cigar.  Great, therefore, was my disappointment when,
at the last moment, a gentleman came hurrying along the
platform, glanced into my carriage, opened the locked door
with a private key, and stepped in.
</p>

<p>
It struck me at the first glance that I had seen him
before&mdash;a tall, spare man, thin-lipped, light-eyed, with an
ungraceful stoop in the shoulders, and scant gray hair worn
somewhat long upon the collar.  He carried a light waterproof
coat, an umbrella, and a large brown japanned deed-box,
which last he placed under the seat.  This done, he felt
carefully in his breast-pocket, as if to make certain of the
safety of his purse or pocketbook, laid his umbrella in the
netting overhead, spread the waterproof across his knees,
and exchanged his hat for a traveling-cap of some Scotch
material.  By this time the train was moving out of the
station and into the faint gray of the wintry twilight beyond.
</p>

<p>
I now recognized my companion.  I recognized him from
the moment when he removed his hat and uncovered the
lofty, furrowed, and somewhat narrow brow beneath.  I had
met him, as I distinctly remembered, some three years
before, at the very house for which, in all probability, he was
now bound, like myself.  His name was Dwerrihouse; he
was a lawyer by profession, and, if I was not greatly mistaken,
was first cousin to the wife of my host.  I knew also
that he was a man eminently "well-to-do," both as regarded
his professional and private means.  The Jelfs entertained
him with that sort of observant courtesy which falls to the
lot of the rich relation, the children made much of him, and
the old butler, albeit somewhat surly "to the general," treated
him with deference.  I thought, observing him by the vague
mixture of lamplight and twilight, that Mrs. Jelf's cousin
looked all the worse for the three years' wear and tear which
had gone over his head since our last meeting.  He was
very pale, and had a restless light in his eye that I did not
remember to have observed before.  The anxious lines, too,
about his mouth were deepened, and there was a cavernous,
hollow look about his cheeks and temples which seemed to
speak of sickness or sorrow.  He had glanced at me as he
came in, but without any gleam of recognition in his face.
Now he glanced again, as I fancied, somewhat doubtfully.
When he did so for the third or fourth time I ventured to
address him.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. John Dwerrihouse, I think?"
</p>

<p>
"That is my name," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"I had the pleasure of meeting you at Dumbleton about
three years ago."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dwerrihouse bowed.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I knew your face," he said; "but your name,
I regret to say&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Langford&mdash;William Langford.  I have known Jonathan
Jelf since we were boys together at Merchant Taylor's, and
I generally spend a few weeks at Dumbleton in the
shooting season.  I suppose we are bound for the same
destination?"
</p>

<p>
"Not if you are on your way to the manor," he replied.
"I am traveling upon business&mdash;rather troublesome
business too&mdash;while you, doubtless, have only pleasure
in view."
</p>

<p>
"Just so.  I am in the habit of looking forward to this
visit as to the brightest three weeks in all the year."
</p>

<p>
"It is a pleasant house," said Mr. Dwerrihouse.
</p>

<p>
"The pleasantest I know."
</p>

<p>
"And Jelf is thoroughly hospitable."
</p>

<p>
"The best and kindest fellow in the world!"
</p>

<p>
"They have invited me to spend Christmas week with
them," pursued Mr. Dwerrihouse, after a moment's pause.
</p>

<p>
"And you are coming?"
</p>

<p>
"I can not tell.  It must depend on the issue of this
business which I have in hand.  You have heard perhaps that
we are about to construct a branch line from Blackwater to
Stockbridge."
</p>

<p>
I explained that I had been for some months away from
England, and had therefore heard nothing of the
contemplated improvement.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dwerrihouse smiled complacently.
</p>

<p>
"It will be an improvement," he said, "a great improvement.
Stockbridge is a flourishing town, and needs but a
more direct railway communication with the metropolis to
become an important centre of commerce.  This branch was
my own idea.  I brought the project before the board, and
have myself superintended the execution of it up to the
present time."
</p>

<p>
"You are an East Anglian director, I presume?"
</p>

<p>
"My interest in the company," replied Mr. Dwerrihouse,
"is threefold.  I am a director, I am a considerable
shareholder, and, as head of the firm of Dwerrihouse,
Dwerrihouse &amp; Craik, I am the company's principal solicitor."
</p>

<p>
Loquacious, self-important, full of his pet project, and
apparently unable to talk on any other subject, Mr. Dwerrihouse
then went on to tell of the opposition he had encountered
and the obstacles he had overcome in the cause of the
Stockbridge branch.  I was entertained with a multitude of
local details and local grievances.  The rapacity of one
squire, the impracticability of another, the indignation of the
rector whose glebe was threatened, the culpable indifference
of the Stockbridge townspeople, who could not be
brought to see that their most vital interests hinged upon
a junction with the Great East Anglian line; the spite of the
local newspaper, and the unheard-of difficulties attending
the Common question, were each and all laid before me with
a circumstantiality that possessed the deepest interest for
my excellent fellow-traveler, but none whatever for myself.
From these, to my despair, he went on to more intricate
matters: to the approximate expenses of construction per
mile; to the estimates sent in by different contractors; to the
probable traffic returns of the new line; to the provisional
clauses of the new act as enumerated in Schedule D of the
company's last half-yearly report; and so on and on and on,
till my head ached and my attention flagged and my eyes
kept closing in spite of every effort that I made to keep
them open.  At length I was roused by these words:
</p>

<p>
"Seventy-five thousand pounds, cash down."
</p>

<p>
"Seventy-five thousand pounds, cash down," I repeated,
in the liveliest tone I could assume.  "That is a heavy sum."
</p>

<p>
"A heavy sum to carry here," replied Mr. Dwerrihouse,
pointing significantly to his breast-pocket, "but a mere
fraction of what we shall ultimately have to pay."
</p>

<p>
"You do not mean to say that you have seventy-five thousand
pounds at this moment upon your person?" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"My good sir, have I not been telling you so for the last
half-hour?" said Mr. Dwerrihouse, testily.  "That money has
to be paid over at half-past eight o'clock this evening, at the
office of Sir Thomas's solicitors, on completion of the deed
of sale."
</p>

<p>
"But how will you get across by night from Blackwater
to Stockbridge with seventy-five thousand pounds in your
pock it?"
</p>

<p>
"To Stockbridge!" echoed the lawyer.  "I find I have
made myself very imperfectly understood.  I thought I had
explained how this sum only carries us as far as Mallingford&mdash;the
first stage, as it were, of our journey&mdash;and how our
route from Blackwater to Mallingford lies entirely through
Sir Thomas Liddell's property."
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," I stammered.  "I fear my thoughts
were wandering.  So you only go as far as Mallingford
to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Precisely.  I shall get a conveyance from the 'Blackwater
Arms.'  And you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jelf sends a trap to meet me at Clayborough!  Can
I be the bearer of any message from you?"
</p>

<p>
"You may say, if you please, Mr. Langford, that I wished
I could have been your companion all the way, and that I
will come over, if possible, before Christmas."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing more?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dwerrihouse smiled grimly.  "Well," he said, "you
may tell my cousin that she need not burn the hall down in
my honor this time, and that I shall be obliged if she will
order the blue-room chimney to be swept before I arrive."
</p>

<p>
"That sounds tragic.  Had you a conflagration on the
occasion of your last visit to Dumbleton?"
</p>

<p>
"Something like it.  There had been no fire lighted in
my bedroom since the spring, the flue was foul, and the
rooks had built in it; so when I went up to dress for dinner
I found the room full of smoke and the chimney on fire.
Are we already at Blackwater?"
</p>

<p>
The train had gradually come to a pause while Mr. Dwerrihouse
was speaking, and, on putting my head out of the
window, I could see the station some few hundred yards
ahead.  There was another train before us blocking the way,
and the guard was making use of the delay to collect the
Blackwater tickets.  I had scarcely ascertained our position
when the ruddy-faced official appeared at our carriage door.
</p>

<p>
"Tickets, sir!" said he.
</p>

<p>
"I am for Clayborough," I replied, holding out the tiny
pink card.
</p>

<p>
He took it, glanced at it by the light of his little lantern,
gave it back, looked, as I fancied, somewhat sharply at my
fellow-traveler, and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"He did not ask for yours," I said, with some surprise.
</p>

<p>
"They never do," replied Mr. Dwerrihouse; "they all
know me, and of course I travel free."
</p>

<p>
"Blackwater!  Blackwater!" cried the porter, running along
the platform beside us as we glided into the station.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dwerrihouse pulled out his deed-box, put his
traveling-cap in his pocket, resumed his hat, took down his
umbrella, and prepared to be gone.
</p>

<p>
"Many thanks, Mr. Langford, for your society," he said,
with old-fashioned courtesy.  "I wish you a good-evening."
</p>

<p>
"Good-evening," I replied, putting out my hand.
</p>

<p>
But he either did not see it or did not choose to see it,
and, slightly lifting his hat, stepped out upon the platform.
Having done this, he moved slowly away and mingled with
the departing crowd.
</p>

<p>
Leaning forward to watch him out of sight, I trod upon
something which proved to be a cigar-case.  It had fallen,
no doubt, from the pocket of his waterproof coat, and was
made of dark morocco leather, with a silver monogram upon
the side.  I sprang out of the carriage just as the guard came
up to lock me in.
</p>

<p>
"Is there one minute to spare?" I asked, eagerly.  "The
gentleman who traveled down with me from town has
dropped his cigar-case; he is not yet out of the station."
</p>

<p>
"Just a minute and a half, sir," replied the guard.  "You
must be quick."
</p>

<p>
I dashed along the platform as fast as my feet could carry
me.  It was a large station, and Mr. Dwerrihouse had by
this time got more than half-way to the farther end.
</p>

<p>
I, however, saw him distinctly, moving slowly with the
stream.  Then, as I drew nearer, I saw that he had met
some friend, that they were talking as they walked, that they
presently fell back somewhat from the crowd and stood aside
in earnest conversation.  I made straight for the spot where
they were waiting.  There was a vivid gas-jet just above
their heads, and the light fell full upon their faces.  I saw
both distinctly&mdash;the face of Mr. Dwerrihouse and the face
of his companion.  Running, breathless, eager as I was,
getting in the way of porters and passengers, and fearful every
instant lest I should see the train going on without me, I
yet observed that the new-comer was considerably younger
and shorter than the director, that he was sandy-haired,
mustachioed, small-featured, and dressed in a close-cut suit of
Scotch tweed.  I was now within a few yards of them.  I
ran against a stout gentleman, I was nearly knocked down by
a luggage-truck, I stumbled over a carpet-bag; I gained the
spot just as the driver's whistle warned me to return.
</p>

<p>
To my utter stupefaction, they were no longer there.  I
had seen them but two seconds before&mdash;and they were gone!
I stood still; I looked to right and left; I saw no sign of
them in any direction.  It was as if the platform had gaped
and swallowed them.
</p>

<p>
"There were two gentlemen standing here a moment ago,"
I said to a porter at my elbow; "which way can they have
gone?"
</p>

<p>
"I saw no gentlemen, sir," replied the man.
</p>

<p>
The whistle shrilled out again.  The guard, far up the
platform, held up his arm, and shouted to me to "come on!"
</p>

<p>
"If you're going on by this train, sir," said the porter,
"you must run for it."
</p>

<p>
I did run for it, just gained the carriage as the train
began to move, was shoved in by the guard, and left, breathless
and bewildered, with Mr. Dwerrihouse's cigar-case still
in my hand.
</p>

<p>
It was the strangest disappearance in the world; it was
like a transformation trick in a pantomime.  They were
there one moment&mdash;palpably there, talking, with the gaslight
full upon their faces&mdash;and the next moment they were gone.
There was no door near, no window, no staircase; it was a
mere slip of barren platform, tapestried with big
advertisements.  Could anything be more mysterious?
</p>

<p>
It was not worth thinking about, and yet, for my life, I
could not help pondering upon it&mdash;pondering, wondering,
conjecturing, turning it over and over in my mind, and beating
my brains for a solution of the enigma.  I thought of it
all the way from Blackwater to Clayborough.  I thought of
it all the way from Clayborough to Dumbleton, as I rattled
along the smooth highway in a trim dog-cart, drawn by a
splendid black mare and driven by the silentest and
dapperest of East Anglian grooms.
</p>

<p>
We did the nine miles in something less than an hour,
and pulled up before the lodge gates just as the church clock
was striking half-past seven.  A couple of minutes more,
and the warm glow of the lighted hall was flooding out upon
the gravel, a hearty grasp was on my hand, and a clear
jovial voice was bidding me "welcome to Dumbleton."
</p>

<p>
"And now, my dear fellow," said my host, when the first
greeting was over, "you have no time to spare.  We dine at
eight, and there are people coming to meet you, so you must
just get the dressing business over as quickly as may be.  By
the way, you will meet some acquaintances; the Biddulphs
are coming, and Prendergast (Prendergast of the Skirmishers)
is staying in the house.  Adieu!  Mrs. Jelf will be
expecting you in the drawing-room."
</p>

<p>
I was ushered to my room&mdash;not the blue room, of which
Mr. Dwerrihouse had made disagreeable experience, but a
pretty little bachelor's chamber, hung with a delicate chintz
and made cheerful by a blazing fire.  I unlocked my
portmanteau.  I tried to be expeditious, but the memory of my
railway adventure haunted me.  I could not get free of it;
I could not shake it off.  It impeded me, it worried me, it
tripped me up, it caused me to mislay my studs, to mistie
my cravat, to wrench the buttons off my gloves.  Worst of
all, it made me so late that the party had all assembled before
I reached the drawing-room.  I had scarcely paid my
respects to Mrs. Jelf when dinner was announced, and we
paired off, some eight or ten couples strong, into the
dining-room.
</p>

<p>
I am not going to describe either the guests or the dinner.
All provincial parties bear the strictest family
resemblance, and I am not aware that an East Anglian banquet
offers any exception to the rule.  There was the usual
country baronet and his wife; there were the usual country
parsons and their wives; there was the sempiternal turkey and
haunch of venison.  <i>Vanitas vanitatum</i>.  There is nothing
new under the sun.
</p>

<p>
I was placed about midway down the table.  I had taken
one rector's wife down to dinner, and I had another at my
left hand.  They talked across me, and their talk was about
babies; it was dreadfully dull.  At length there came a pause.
The entrées had just been removed, and the turkey had come
upon the scene.  The conversation had all along been of the
languidest, but at this moment it happened to have stagnated
altogether.  Jelf was carving the turkey; Mrs. Jelf
looked as if she was trying to think of something to say;
everybody else was silent.  Moved by an unlucky impulse, I
thought I would relate my adventure.
</p>

<p>
"By the way, Jelf," I began, "I came down part of the
way to-day with a friend of yours."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" said the master of the feast, slicing
scientifically into the breast of the turkey.  "With whom,
pray?"
</p>

<p>
"With one who bade me tell you that he should, if
possible, pay you a visit before Christmas."
</p>

<p>
"I can not think who that could be," said my friend,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
"It must be Major Thorp," suggested Mrs. Jelf.  I shook
my head.
</p>

<p>
"It was not Major Thorp," I replied; "it was a near
relation of your own, Mrs. Jelf."
</p>

<p>
"Then I am more puzzled than ever," replied my hostess.
"Pray tell me who it was."
</p>

<p>
"It was no less a person than your cousin, Mr. John
Dwerrihouse."
</p>

<p>
Jonathan Jelf laid down his knife and fork.  Mrs. Jelf
looked at me in a strange, startled way, and said never a
word.
</p>

<p>
"And he desired me to tell you, my dear madam, that
you need not take the trouble to burn the hall down in his
honor this time, but only to have the chimney of the blue
room swept before his arrival."
</p>

<p>
Before I had reached the end of my sentence I became
aware of something ominous in the faces of the guests.  I
felt I had said something which I had better have left
unsaid, and that for some unexplained reason my words had
evoked a general consternation.  I sat confounded, not daring
to utter another syllable, and for at least two whole minutes
there was dead silence round the table.  Then Captain
Prendergast came to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
"You have been abroad for some months, have you not,
Mr. Langford?" he said, with the desperation of one who
flings himself into the breach.  "I heard you had been to
Russia.  Surely you have something to tell us of the state
and temper of the country after the war?"
</p>

<p>
I was heartily grateful to the gallant Skirmisher for this
diversion in my favor.  I answered him, I fear, somewhat
lamely; but he kept the conversation up, and presently one
or two others joined in, and so the difficulty, whatever it
might have been, was bridged over&mdash;bridged over, but not
repaired.  A something, an awkwardness, a visible constraint
remained.  The guests hitherto had been simply dull, but
now they were evidently uncomfortable and embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
The dessert had scarcely been placed upon the table
when the ladies left the room.  I seized the opportunity to
select a vacant chair next Captain Prendergast.
</p>

<p>
"In Heaven's name," I whispered, "what was the matter
just now?  What had I said?"
</p>

<p>
"You mentioned the name of John Dwerrihouse."
</p>

<p>
"What of that?  I had seen him not two hours before."
</p>

<p>
"It is a most astounding circumstance that you should
have seen him," said Captain Prendergast.  "Are you sure
it was he?"
</p>

<p>
"As sure as of my own identity.  We were talking all
the way between London and Blackwater.  But why does
that surprise you?"
</p>

<p>
"Because," replied Captain Prendergast, dropping his
voice to the lowest whisper&mdash;"<i>because John Dwerrihouse
absconded three months ago with seventy-five thousand pounds of
the company's money, and has never been heard of since.</i>"
</p>

<p>
John Dwerrihouse had absconded three months ago&mdash;and
I had seen him only a few hours back!  John Dwerrihouse
had embezzled seventy-five thousand pounds of the
company's money, yet told me that he carried that sum upon
his person!  Were ever facts so strangely incongruous, so
difficult to reconcile?  How should he have ventured again
into the light of day?  How dared he show himself along
the line?  Above all, what had he been doing throughout
those mysterious three months of disappearance?
</p>

<p>
Perplexing questions these&mdash;questions which at once
suggested themselves to the minds of all concerned, but
which admitted of no easy solution.  I could find no reply
to them.  Captain Prendergast had not even a suggestion
to offer.  Jonathan Jelf, who seized the first opportunity
of drawing me aside and learning all that I had to tell,
was more amazed and bewildered than either of us.  He
came to my room that night, when all the guests were gone,
and we talked the thing over from every point of view;
without, it must be confessed, arriving at any kind of
conclusion.
</p>

<p>
"I do not ask you," he said, "whether you can have
mistaken your man.  That is impossible."
</p>

<p>
"As impossible as that I should mistake some stranger
for yourself."
</p>

<p>
"It is not a question of looks or voice, but of facts.  That
he should have alluded to the fire in the blue room is proof
enough of John Dwerrihouse's identity.  How did he look?"
</p>

<p>
"Older, I thought; considerably older, paler, and more
anxious."
</p>

<p>
"He has had enough to make him look anxious, anyhow,"
said my friend, gloomily, "be he innocent or guilty."
</p>

<p>
"I am inclined to believe that he is innocent," I replied.
"He showed no embarrassment when I addressed him, and
no uneasiness when the guard came round.  His conversation
was open to a fault.  I might almost say that he talked
too freely of the business which he had in hand."
</p>

<p>
"That again is strange, for I know no one more reticent
on such subjects.  He actually told you that he had the
seventy-five thousand pounds in his pocket?"
</p>

<p>
"He did."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!  My wife has an idea about it, and she may
be right&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What idea?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, she fancies&mdash;women are so clever, you know, at
putting themselves inside people's motives&mdash;she fancies that
he was tempted, that he did actually take the money, and
that he has been concealing himself these three months in
some wild part of the country, struggling possibly with his
conscience all the time, and daring neither to abscond with
his booty nor to come back and restore it."
</p>

<p>
"But now that he has come back?"
</p>

<p>
"That is the point.  She conceives that he has probably
thrown himself upon the company's mercy, made restitution
of the money, and, being forgiven, is permitted to carry the
business through as if nothing whatever had happened."
</p>

<p>
"The last," I replied, "is an impossible case.  Mrs. Jelf
thinks like a generous and delicate-minded woman, but not
in the least like a board of railway directors.  They would
never carry forgiveness so far."
</p>

<p>
"I fear not; and yet it is the only conjecture that bears
a semblance of likelihood.  However, we can run over to
Clayborough to-morrow and see if anything is to be learned.
By the way, Prendergast tells me you picked up his cigar-case."
</p>

<p>
"I did so, and here it is."
</p>

<p>
Jelf took the cigar-case, examined it by the light of the
lamp, and said at once that it was beyond doubt
Mr. Dwerrihouse's property, and that he remembered to have seen
him use it.
</p>

<p>
"Here, too, is his monogram on the side," he added&mdash;"a
big J transfixing a capital D.  He used to carry the same
on his note-paper."
</p>

<p>
"It offers, at all events, a proof that I was not dreaming."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, but it is time you were asleep and dreaming now.
I am ashamed to have kept you up so long.  Good-night."
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, and remember that I am more than ready
to go with you to Clayborough, or Blackwater, or London,
or anywhere, if I can be of the least service."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!  I know you mean it, old friend, and it may
be that I shall put you to the test.  Once more,
good-night."
</p>

<p>
So we parted for that night, and met again in the
breakfast-room at half-past eight next morning.  It was a hurried,
silent, uncomfortable meal; none of us had slept well, and
all were thinking of the same subject.  Mrs. Jelf had
evidently been crying, Jelf was impatient to be off, and both
Captain Prendergast and myself felt ourselves to be in the
painful position of outsiders who are involuntarily brought
into a domestic trouble.  Within twenty minutes after we
had left the breakfast-table the dog-cart was brought round,
and my friend and I were on the road to Clayborough.
</p>

<p>
"Tell you what it is, Langford," he said, as we sped along
between the wintry hedges, "I do not much fancy to bring up
Dwerrihouse's name at Clayborough.  All the officials know
that he is my wife's relation, and the subject just now is
hardly a pleasant one.  If you don't much mind, we will take
the 11:10 to Blackwater.  It's an important station, and we
shall stand a far better chance of picking up information
there than at Clayborough."
</p>

<p>
So we took the 11:10, which happened to be an express,
and, arriving at Blackwater about a quarter before twelve,
proceeded at once to prosecute our inquiry.
</p>

<p>
We began by asking for the station-master, a big, blunt,
business-like person, who at once averred that he knew
Mr. John Dwerrihouse perfectly well, and that there was no
director on the line whom he had seen and spoken to so
frequently.
</p>

<p>
"He used to be down here two or three times a week
about three months ago," said he, "when the new line was
first set afoot; but since then, you know, gentlemen&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused significantly.
</p>

<p>
Jelf flushed scarlet.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," he said, hurriedly; "we know all about that.
The point now to be ascertained is whether anything has
been seen or heard of him lately."
</p>

<p>
"Not to my knowledge," replied the station-master.
</p>

<p>
"He is not known to have been down the line any time
yesterday, for instance?"
</p>

<p>
The station-master shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"The East Anglian, sir," said he, "is about the last place
where he would dare to show himself.  Why, there isn't
a station-master, there isn't a guard, there isn't a porter, who
doesn't know Mr. Dwerrihouse by sight as well as he knows
his own face in the looking-glass, or who wouldn't telegraph
for the police as soon as he had set eyes on him at any
point along the line.  Bless you, sir! there's been a standing
order out against him ever since the 25th of September
last."
</p>

<p>
"And yet," pursued my friend, "a gentleman who traveled
down yesterday from London to Clayborough by the afternoon
express testifies that he saw Mr. Dwerrihouse in the
train, and that Mr. Dwerrihouse alighted at Blackwater
station."
</p>

<p>
"Quite impossible, sir," replied the station-master,
promptly.
</p>

<p>
"Why impossible?"
</p>

<p>
"Because there is no station along the line where he is so
well known or where he would run so great a risk.  It would
be just running his head into the lion's mouth; he would
have been mad to come nigh Blackwater station; and if he
had come he would have been arrested before he left the
platform."
</p>

<p>
"Can you tell me who took the Blackwater tickets of that
train?"
</p>

<p>
"I can, sir.  It was the guard, Benjamin Somers."
</p>

<p>
"And where can I find him?"
</p>

<p>
"You can find him, sir, by staying here, if you please, till
one o'clock.  He will be coming through with the up express
from Crampton, which stays at Blackwater for ten minutes."
</p>

<p>
We waited for the up express, beguiling the time as best
we could by strolling along the Blackwater road till we came
almost to the outskirts of the town, from which the station
was distant nearly a couple of miles.  By one o'clock we
were back again upon the platform and waiting for the
train.  It came punctually, and I at once recognized the
ruddy-faced guard who had gone down with my train the
evening before.
</p>

<p>
"The gentlemen want to ask you something about
Mr. Dwerrihouse, Somers," said the station-master, by way of
introduction.
</p>

<p>
The guard flashed a keen glance from my face to Jelf's
and back again to mine.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. John Dwerrihouse, the late director?" said he,
interrogatively.
</p>

<p>
"The same," replied my friend.  "Should you know him
if you saw him?"
</p>

<p>
"Anywhere, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know if he was in the 4:15 express yesterday
afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
"He was not, sir."
</p>

<p>
"How can you answer so positively?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I looked into every carriage and saw every
face in that train, and I could take my oath that Mr. Dwerrihouse
was not in it.  This gentleman was," he added, turning
sharply upon me.  "I don't know that I ever saw him
before in my life, but I remember his face perfectly.  You
nearly missed taking your seat in time at this station, sir,
and you got out at Clayborough."
</p>

<p>
"Quite true, guard," I replied; "but do you not also
remember the face of the gentleman who traveled down in the
same carriage with me as far as here?"
</p>

<p>
"It was my impression, sir, that you traveled down alone,"
said Somers, with a look of some surprise.
</p>

<p>
"By no means.  I had a fellow-traveler as far as Blackwater,
and it was in trying to restore him the cigar-case
which he had dropped in the carriage that I so nearly let you
go on without me."
</p>

<p>
"I remember your saying something about a cigar-case,
certainly," replied the guard; "but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You asked for my ticket just before we entered the
station."
</p>

<p>
"I did, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Then you must have seen him.  He sat in the corner
next the very door to which you came."
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed; I saw no one."
</p>

<p>
I looked at Jelf.  I began to think the guard was in the
ex-director's confidence, and paid for his silence.
</p>

<p>
"If I had seen another traveler I should have asked for
his ticket," added Somers.  "Did you see me ask for his
ticket, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I observed that you did not ask for it, but he explained
that by saying&mdash;" I hesitated.  I feared I might be telling
too much, and so broke off abruptly.
</p>

<p>
The guard and the station-master exchanged glances.
The former looked impatiently at his watch.
</p>

<p>
"I am obliged to go on in four minutes more, sir," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"One last question, then."  interposed Jelf, with a sort
of desperation.  "If this gentleman's fellow-traveler had
been Mr. John Dwerrihouse, and he had been sitting in the
corner next the door by which you took the tickets, could
you have failed to see and recognize him?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; it would have been quite impossible."
</p>

<p>
"And you are certain you did not see him?"
</p>

<p>
"As I said before, sir, I could take my oath I did not see
him.  And if it wasn't that I don't like to contradict a
gentleman, I would say I could also take my oath that this
gentleman was quite alone in the carriage the whole way
from London to Clayborough.  Why, sir," he added, dropping
his voice so as to be inaudible to the station-master,
who had been called away to speak to some person close by,
"you expressly asked me to give you a compartment to
yourself, and I did so.  I locked you in, and you were so
good as to give me something for myself."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but Mr. Dwerrihouse had a key of his own."
</p>

<p>
"I never saw him, sir; I saw no one in that compartment
but yourself.  Beg pardon, sir; my time's up."
</p>

<p>
And with this the ruddy guard touched his cap and was
gone.  In another minute the heavy panting of the engine
began afresh, and the train glided slowly out of the station.
</p>

<p>
We looked at each other for some moments in silence.
I was the first to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Benjamin Somers knows more than he chooses to
tell," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Humph! do you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"It must be.  He could not have come to the door without
seeing him; it's impossible."
</p>

<p>
"There is one thing not impossible, my dear fellow."
</p>

<p>
"What is that?"
</p>

<p>
"That you may have fallen asleep and dreamed the whole
thing."
</p>

<p>
"Could I dream of a branch line that I had never heard
of?  Could I dream of a hundred and one business details
that had no kind of interest for me?  Could I dream of the
seventy-five thousand pounds?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you might have seen or heard some vague account
of the affair while you were abroad.  It might have
made no impression upon you at the time, and might have
come back to you in your dreams, recalled perhaps by the
mere names of the stations on the line."
</p>

<p>
"What about the fire in the chimney of the blue
room&mdash;should I have heard of that during my journey?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, no; I admit there is a difficulty about that point."
</p>

<p>
"And what about the cigar-case?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, by Jove! there is the cigar-case.  That is a stubborn
fact.  Well, it's a mysterious affair, and it will need a better
detective than myself, I fancy, to clear it up.  I suppose we
may as well go home."
</p>

<p>
A week had not gone by when I received a letter from
the secretary of the East Anglian Railway Company,
requesting the favor of my attendance at a special board
meeting not then many days distant.  No reasons were alleged
and no apologies offered for this demand upon my time, but
they had heard, it was clear, of my inquiries anent the
missing director, and had a mind to put me through some sort
of official examination upon the subject.  Being still a guest
at Dumbleton Hall, I had to go up to London for the
purpose, and Jonathan Jelf accompanied me.  I found the
direction of the Great East Anglian line represented by a party
of some twelve or fourteen gentlemen seated in solemn
conclave round a huge green baize table, in a gloomy
boardroom adjoining the London terminus.
</p>

<p>
Being courteously received by the chairman (who at
once began by saying that certain statements of mine
respecting Mr. John Dwerrihouse had come to the knowledge
of the direction, and that they in consequence desired to
confer with me on those points), we were placed at the table,
and the inquiry proceeded in due form.
</p>

<p>
I was first asked if I knew Mr. John Dwerrihouse, how
long I had been acquainted with him, and whether I could
identify him at sight.  I was then asked when I had seen
him last.  To which I replied: "On the 4th of this present
month, December, 1856."  Then came the inquiry of where
I had seen him on that fourth day of December; to which
I replied that I met him in a first-class compartment of
the 4:15 down express, that he got in just as the train was
leaving the London terminus, and that he alighted at
Blackwater station.  The chairman then inquired whether I had
held any communication with my fellow-traveler; whereupon
I related, as nearly as I could remember it, the whole bulk
and substance of Mr. John Dwerrihouse's diffuse information
respecting the new branch line.
</p>

<p>
To all this the board listened with profound attention,
while the chairman presided and the secretary took notes.
I then produced the cigar-case.  It was passed from hand to
hand, and recognized by all.  There was not a man present
who did not remember that plain cigar-case with its silver
monogram, or to whom it seemed anything less than entirely
corroborative of my evidence.  When at length I had told
all that I had to tell, the chairman whispered something to
the secretary; the secretary touched a silver hand-bell, and
the guard, Benjamin Somers, was ushered into the room.
He was then examined as carefully as myself.  He declared
that he knew Mr. John Dwerrihouse perfectly well, that he
could not be mistaken in him, that he remembered going
down with the 4:15 express on the afternoon in question,
that he remembered me, and that, there being one or two
empty first-class compartments on that especial afternoon,
he had, in compliance with my request, placed me in a
carriage by myself.  He was positive that I remained alone
in that compartment all the way from London to Clayborough.
He was ready to take his oath that Mr. Dwerrihouse
was neither in that carriage with me, nor in any compartment
of that train.  He remembered distinctly to have examined
my ticket at Blackwater; was certain that there was
no one else at that time in the carriage; could not have failed
to observe a second person, if there had been one; had that
second person been Mr. John Dwerrihouse should have
quietly double-locked the door of the carriage and have at
once given information to the Blackwater station-master.
So clear, so decisive, so ready, was Somers with this
testimony, that the board looked fairly puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"You hear this person's statement, Mr. Langford," said
the chairman.  "It contradicts yours in every particular.
What have you to say in reply?"
</p>

<p>
"I can only repeat what I said before.  I am quite as
positive of the truth of my own assertions as Mr. Somers
can be of the truth of his."
</p>

<p>
"You say that Mr. Dwerrihouse alighted at Blackwater,
and that he was in possession of a private key.  Are you
sure that he had not alighted by means of that key before
the guard came round for the tickets?"
</p>

<p>
"I am quite positive that he did not leave the carriage
till the train had fairly entered the station, and the other
Blackwater passengers alighted.  I even saw that he was
met there by a friend."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!  Did you see that person distinctly?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite distinctly."
</p>

<p>
"Can you describe his appearance?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so.  He was short and very slight, sandy-haired,
with a bushy mustache and beard, and he wore a closely
fitting suit of gray tweed, His age I should take to be
about thirty-eight or forty."
</p>

<p>
"Did Mr. Dwerrihouse leave the station in this person's
company?"
</p>

<p>
"I can not tell.  I saw them walking together down the
platform, and then I saw them standing aside under a gas-jet,
talking earnestly.  After that I lost sight of them quite
suddenly, and just then my train went on, and I with it."
</p>

<p>
The chairman and secretary conferred together in an
undertone.  The directors whispered to one another.  One
or two looked suspiciously at the guard.  I could see that my
evidence remained unshaken, and that, like myself, they
suspected some complicity between the guard and the defaulter.
</p>

<p>
"How far did you conduct that 4:15 express on the day
in question, Somers?" asked the chairman.
</p>

<p>
"All through, sir," replied the guard, "from London to
Crampton."
</p>

<p>
"How was it that you were not relieved at Clayborough?
I thought there was always a change of guards at
Clayborough."
</p>

<p>
"There used to be, sir, till the new regulations came in
force last midsummer, since when the guards in charge of
express trains go the whole way through."
</p>

<p>
The chairman turned to the secretary.
</p>

<p>
"I think it would be as well," he said, "if we had the
day-book to refer to upon this point."
</p>

<p>
Again the secretary touched the silver hand-bell, and
desired the porter in attendance to summon Mr. Raikes.  From
a word or two dropped by another of the directors I gathered
that Mr. Raikes was one of the under-secretaries.
</p>

<p>
He came, a small, slight, sandy-haired, keen-eyed man,
with an eager, nervous manner, and a forest of light beard
and mustache.  He just showed himself at the door of the
board-room, and, being requested to bring a certain
day-book from a certain shelf in a certain room, bowed and
vanished.
</p>

<p>
He was there such a moment, and the surprise of seeing
him was so great and sudden, that it was not till the door
had closed upon him that I found voice to speak.  He was
no sooner gone, however, than I sprang to my feet.
</p>

<p>
"That person," I said, "is the same who met Mr. Dwerrihouse
upon the platform at Blackwater!"
</p>

<p>
There was a general movement of surprise.  The chairman
looked grave and somewhat agitated.
</p>

<p>
"Take care, Mr. Langford," he said; "take care what
you say."
</p>

<p>
"I am as positive of his identity as of my own."
</p>

<p>
"Do you consider the consequences of your words?  Do
you consider that you are bringing a charge of the gravest
character against one of the company's servants?"
</p>

<p>
"I am willing to be put upon my oath, if necessary.  The
man who came to that door a minute since is the same whom
I saw talking with Mr. Dwerrihouse on the Blackwater
platform.  Were he twenty times the company's servant, I could
say neither more nor less."
</p>

<p>
The chairman turned again to the guard.
</p>

<p>
"Did you see Mr. Raikes in the train or on the platform?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
Somers shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I am confident Mr. Raikes was not in the train," he said,
"and I certainly did not see him on the platform."
</p>

<p>
The chairman turned next to the secretary.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Raikes is in your office, Mr. Hunter," he said.  "Can
you remember if he was absent on the 4th instant?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not think he was," replied the secretary, "but I
am not prepared to speak positively.  I have been away most
afternoons myself lately, and Mr. Raikes might easily have
absented himself if he had been disposed."
</p>

<p>
At this moment the under-secretary returned with the
day-book under his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Be pleased to refer, Mr. Raikes," said the chairman, "to
the entries of the 4th instant, and see what Benjamin
Somers's duties were on that day."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Raikes threw open the cumbrous volume, and ran
a practised eye and finger down some three or four successive
columns of entries.  Stopping suddenly at the foot of
a page, he then read aloud that Benjamin Somers had on
that day conducted the 4:15 express from London to
Crampton.
</p>

<p>
The chairman leaned forward in his seat, looked the
under-secretary full in the face, and said, quite sharply and
suddenly:
</p>

<p>
"And where were you, Mr. Raikes, on the same afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i>, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"You, Mr. Raikes.  Where were you on the afternoon
and evening of the 4th of the present month?"
</p>

<p>
"Here, sir, in Mr. Hunter's office.  Where else should
I be?"
</p>

<p>
There was a dash of trepidation in the under-secretary's
voice as he said this, but his look of surprise was natural
enough.
</p>

<p>
"We have some reason for believing, Mr. Raikes, that
you were absent that afternoon without leave.  Was this the
case?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not, sir.  I have not had a day's holiday since
September.  Mr. Hunter will bear me out in this."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hunter repeated what he had previously said on the
subject, but added that the clerks in the adjoining office
would be certain to know.  Whereupon the senior clerk, a
grave, middle-aged person in green glasses, was summoned
and interrogated.
</p>

<p>
His testimony cleared the under-secretary at once.  He
declared that Mr. Raikes had in no instance, to his knowledge,
been absent during office hours since his return from
his annual holiday in September.
</p>

<p>
I was confounded.  The chairman turned to me with a
smile, in which a shade of covert annoyance was scarcely
apparent.
</p>

<p>
"You hear, Mr. Langford?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"I hear, sir; but my conviction remains unshaken."
</p>

<p>
"I fear, Mr. Langford, that your convictions are very
insufficiently based," replied the chairman, with a doubtful
cough.  "I fear that you 'dream dreams,' and mistake them
for actual occurrences.  It is a dangerous habit of mind, and
might lead to dangerous results.  Mr. Raikes here would
have found himself in an unpleasant position had he not
proved so satisfactory an alibi."
</p>

<p>
I was about to reply, but he gave me no time.
</p>

<p>
"I think, gentlemen," he went on to say, addressing the
board, "that we should be wasting time to push this inquiry
further.  Mr. Langford's evidence would seem to be of an
equal value throughout.  The testimony of Benjamin Somers
disproves his first statement, and the testimony of the last
witness disproves his second.  I think we may conclude that
Mr. Langford fell asleep in the train on the occasion of his
journey to Clayborough, and dreamed an unusually vivid
and circumstantial dream, of which, however, we have now
heard quite enough."
</p>

<p>
There are few things more annoying than to find one's
positive convictions met with incredulity.  I could not help
feeling impatience at the turn that affairs had taken.  I was
not proof against the civil sarcasm of the chairman's manner.
Most intolerable of all, however, was the quiet smile lurking
about the corners of Benjamin Somers's mouth, and the
half-triumphant, half-malicious gleam in the eyes of the
under-secretary.  The man was evidently puzzled and somewhat
alarmed.  His looks seemed furtively to interrogate me.
Who was I?  What did I want?  Why had I come there to
do him an ill turn with his employers?  What was it to me
whether or no he was absent without leave?
</p>

<p>
Seeing all this, and perhaps more irritated by it than the
thing deserved, I begged leave to detain the attention of
the board for a moment longer.  Jelf plucked me impatiently
by the sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"Better let the thing drop," he whispered.  "The chairman's
right enough; you dreamed it, and the less said now
the better."
</p>

<p>
I was not to be silenced, however, in this fashion.  I had
yet something to say, and I would say it.  It was to this
effect: that dreams were not usually productive of tangible
results, and that I requested to know in what way the
chairman conceived I had evolved from my dream so substantial
and well-made a delusion as the cigar-case which I had had
the honor to place before him at the commencement of our
interview.
</p>

<p>
"The cigar-case, I admit, Mr. Langford," the chairman
replied, "is a very strong point in your evidence.  It is
your only strong point, however, and there is just a
possibility that we may all be misled by a mere accidental
resemblance.  Will you permit me to see the case again?"
</p>

<p>
"It is unlikely," I said, as I handed it to him, "that any
other should bear precisely this monogram, and yet be in all
other particulars exactly similar."
</p>

<p>
The chairman examined it for a moment in silence, and
then passed it to Mr. Hunter.  Mr. Hunter turned it over
and over, and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"This is no mere resemblance," he said.  "It is John
Dwerrihouse's cigar-case to a certainty.  I remember it
perfectly; I have seen it a hundred times."
</p>

<p>
"I believe I may say the same," added the chairman; "yet
how account for the way in which Mr. Langford asserts
that it came into his possession?"
</p>

<p>
"I can only repeat," I replied, "that I found it on the
floor of the carriage after Mr. Dwerrihouse had alighted.  It
was in leaning out to look after him that I trod upon it,
and it was in running after him for the purpose of restoring
it that I saw, or believed I saw, Mr. Raikes standing aside
with him in earnest conversation."
</p>

<p>
Again I felt Jonathan Jelf plucking at my sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"Look at Raikes," he whispered; "look at Raikes!"
</p>

<p>
I turned to where the under-secretary had been standing
a moment before, and saw him, white as death, with lips
trembling and livid, stealing toward the door.
</p>

<p>
To conceive a sudden, strange, and indefinite suspicion,
to fling myself in his way, to take him by the shoulders as if
he were a child, and turn his craven face, perforce, toward
the board, were with me the work of an instant.
</p>

<p>
"Look at him!" I exclaimed.  "Look at his face!  I ask
no better witness to the truth of my words."
</p>

<p>
The chairman's brow darkened.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Raikes," he said, sternly, "if you know anything
you had better speak."
</p>

<p>
Vainly trying to wrench himself from my grasp, the
under-secretary stammered out an incoherent denial.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go," he said.  "I know nothing&mdash;you have no
right to detain me&mdash;let me go!"
</p>

<p>
"Did you, or did you not, meet Mr. John Dwerrihouse at
Blackwater station?  The charge brought against you is
either true or false.  If true, you will do well to throw
yourself upon the mercy of the board and make full confession
of all that you know."
</p>

<p>
The under-secretary wrung his hands in an agony of
helpless terror.
</p>

<p>
"I was away!" he cried.  "I was two hundred miles away
at the time!  I know nothing about it&mdash;I have nothing to
confess&mdash;I am innocent&mdash;I call God to witness I am innocent!"
</p>

<p>
"Two hundred miles away!" echoed the chairman.  "What
do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I was in Devonshire.  I had three weeks' leave of
absence&mdash;I appeal to Mr. Hunter&mdash;Mr. Hunter knows I had
three weeks' leave of absence!  I was in Devonshire all the
time; I can prove I was in Devonshire!"
</p>

<p>
Seeing him so abject, so incoherent, so wild with
apprehension, the directors began to whisper gravely among
themselves, while one got quietly up and called the porter to
guard the door.
</p>

<p>
"What has your being in Devonshire to do with the matter?"
said the chairman.  "When were you in Devonshire?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Raikes took his leave in September," said the
secretary, "about the time when Mr. Dwerrihouse disappeared."
</p>

<p>
"I never even heard that he had disappeared till I came
back!"
</p>

<p>
"That must remain to be proved," said the chairman.
"I shall at once put this matter in the hands of the police.
In the meanwhile, Mr. Raikes, being myself a magistrate and
used to deal with these cases, I advise you to offer no
resistance, but to confess while confession may yet do you
service.  As for your accomplice&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The frightened wretch fell upon his knees.
</p>

<p>
"I had no accomplice!" he cried.  "Only have mercy
upon me&mdash;only spare my life, and I will confess all!  I didn't
mean to harm him!  I didn't mean to hurt a hair of his
head!  Only have mercy upon me, and let me go!"
</p>

<p>
The chairman rose in his place, pale and agitated.  "Good
heavens!" he exclaimed, "what horrible mystery is this?
What does it mean?"
</p>

<p>
"As sure as there is a God in heaven," said Jonathan Jelf,
"it means that murder has been done."
</p>

<p>
"No! no! no!" shrieked Raikes, still upon his knees, and
cowering like a beaten hound.  "Not murder!  No jury that
ever sat could bring it in murder.  I thought I had only
stunned him&mdash;I never meant to do more than stun him!
Manslaughter&mdash;manslaughter&mdash;not murder!"
</p>

<p>
Overcome by the horror of this unexpected revelation,
the chairman covered his face with his hand and for a
moment or two remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"Miserable man," he said at length, "you have betrayed
yourself."
</p>

<p>
"You bade me confess!  You urged me to throw myself
upon the mercy of the board!"
</p>

<p>
"You have confessed to a crime which no one suspected
you of having committed," replied the chairman, "and which
this board has no power either to punish or forgive.  All
that I can do for you is to advise you to submit to the law,
to plead guilty, and to conceal nothing.  When did you do
this deed?"
</p>

<p>
The guilty man rose to his feet, and leaned heavily against
the table.  His answer came reluctantly, like the speech of
one dreaming.
</p>

<p>
"On the 22d of September."
</p>

<p>
On the 22d of September!  I looked in Jonathan Jelf's
face, and he in mine.  I felt my own paling with a strange
sense of wonder and dread.  I saw his blanch suddenly, even
to the lips.
</p>

<p>
"Merciful heaven!" he whispered.  "<i>What was it, then,
that you saw in the train?</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
What was it that I saw in the train?  That question
remains unanswered to this day.  I have never been able to
reply to it.  I only know that it bore the living likeness of
the murdered man, whose body had then been lying some ten
weeks under a rough pile of branches and brambles and
rotting leaves, at the bottom of a deserted chalk-pit about
half-way between Blackwater and Mallingford.  I know that it
spoke and moved and looked as that man spoke and moved
and looked in life; that I heard, or seemed to hear, things
related which I could never otherwise have learned; that
I was guided, as it were, by that vision on the platform to
the identification of the murderer; and that, a passive
instrument myself, I was destined, by means of these mysterious
teachings, to bring about the ends of justice.  For these
things I have never been able to account.
</p>

<p>
As for that matter of the cigar-case, it proved, on
inquiry, that the carriage in which I traveled down that
afternoon to Clayborough had not been in use for several weeks,
and was, in point of fact, the same in which poor John
Dwerrihouse had performed his last journey.  The case had
doubtless been dropped by him, and had lain unnoticed till
I found it.
</p>

<p>
Upon the details of the murder I have no need to dwell.
Those who desire more ample particulars may find them, and
the written confession of Augustus Raikes, in the files of
the "Times" for 1856.  Enough that the under-secretary,
knowing the history of the new line, and following the
negotiation step by step through all its stages, determined to
waylay Mr. Dwerrihouse, rob him of the seventy-five
thousand pounds, and escape to America with his booty.
</p>

<p>
In order to effect these ends he obtained leave of absence
a few days before the time appointed for the payment
of the money, secured his passage across the Atlantic in a
steamer advertised to start on the 23d, provided himself
with a heavily loaded "life-preserver," and went down to
Blackwater to await the arrival of his victim.  How he met
him on the platform with a pretended message from the
board, how he offered to conduct him by a short cut across
the fields to Mallingford, how, having brought him to a
lonely place, he struck him down with the life-preserver,
and so killed him, and how, finding what he had done, he
dragged the body to the verge of an out-of-the-way chalk-pit,
and there flung it in and piled it over with branches and
brambles, are facts still fresh in the memories of those who,
like the connoisseurs in De Quincey's famous essay,
regard murder as a fine art.  Strangely enough, the murderer,
having done his work, was afraid to leave the country.
He declared that he had not intended to take the director's
life, but only to stun and rob him; and that, finding the
blow had killed, he dared not fly for fear of drawing down
suspicion upon his own head.  As a mere robber he would
have been safe in the States, but as a murderer he would
inevitably have been pursued and given up to justice.  So
he forfeited his passage, returned to the office as usual at the
end of his leave, and locked up his ill-gotten thousands till
a more convenient opportunity.  In the meanwhile he had
the satisfaction of finding that Mr. Dwerrihouse was
universally believed to have absconded with the money, no one
knew how or whither.
</p>

<p>
Whether he meant murder or not, however, Mr. Augustus
Raikes paid the full penalty of his crime, and was hanged
at the Old Bailey in the second week in January, 1857.
Those who desire to make his further acquaintance may see
him any day (admirably done in wax) in the Chamber of
Horrors at Madame Tussaud's exhibition, in Baker Street.
He is there to be found in the midst of a select society of
ladies and gentlemen of atrocious memory, dressed in the
close-cut tweed suit which he wore on the evening of the
murder, and holding in his hand the identical life-preserver
with which he committed it.

OUR LAST WALK
</p>

<p class="t3">
By HUGH CONWAY
</p>

<p>
If I wished to tell a love tale, I should begin this
with the sweetest memories of my life, and relate
when and where Walter Linton and I first met;
should describe my pride and happiness when I
knew that he wished me to become his wife.  The love we
bore each other through life&mdash;ay, even after life&mdash;may be
made manifest as I write these lines, but it is not
because I loved him I have this tale to tell.  Other women
have loved as I love, and have mourned as I mourn: my
life, so far as the joy and grief of it go, is but the life of
thousands.
</p>

<p>
Had Walter Linton, when first he asked me for the heart
which was already his own, been but a poor, struggling man,
I should have given him all as freely as I did then.  If need
had been, I could have waited patiently for years, or until
fortune smiled upon him.  Feeling this, I had no false
sentiment as to sharing the worldly good that was his, although
I was a penniless girl and brought nothing in my hands.  Of
course, kind friends around wondered why Walter did not
choose a wife who would bring him wealth as well as love.
Ah, no one could have given him more love than I could
give him; that was all he wanted or asked for.  He was
twenty-three, and his own master; I was twenty, and utterly
alone in this world.  So we were married&mdash;just six weeks
after that happy spring day on which he told me I was
dearest to him.
</p>

<p>
Our home&mdash;a dear gray old house, full of pleasant
corners&mdash;was Draycot Hall, Somersetshire, not far from the
Mendip Hills.  Walter had recently inherited the house and
the estates of Draycot, and when we took possession of our
kingdom, which was almost as new to Walter as it was to
me, life seemed to hold all that could be desired.  Walter's
income was sufficient for the life of a quiet country
gentleman&mdash;a life to which he settled down, and appeared to find
every wish gratified in that happy existence.  Shooting,
fishing, and hunting gave him plenty of amusement, and the
land, part of which he farmed himself, brought occupation
and interest enough to make him feel that his life was not
altogether an idle or useless one.
</p>

<p>
Then, to make our happiness complete, the children came&mdash;a
girl, then one, two, three bonny boys.  How merry and
busy the old house grew with them, the sturdy rogues!  How
proud Walter was of them!
</p>

<p>
We were not very rich people.  Compared to that of some
of our county neighbors, our income was insignificant.
Draycot Hall, although not such an imposing pile as the name
might suggest, was by no means a small house; and, like all
rambling old places, cost a good deal of money to keep up.
Even when we began life together we found, at the end of
the year, that our expenditure and income nearly tallied,
and as expenses increased with an increasing family, we felt
that a few hundreds added to our revenue would be a very
welcome addition.  But in spite of this our lot was too happy
for us to think of grumbling.
</p>

<p>
We sat one summer's evening on the lawn.  The air was
cooled by late fallen rain, and sweet with fragrance rising
from the freshened flowers&mdash;for days were long and petals
not yet closed.  Our latest given child slept on my knee;
and, as we watched the sun sink slowly down behind the
Mendip Hills, my husband said:
</p>

<p>
"Helena, how shall we manage to start all these boys in
life?"
</p>

<p>
I laughed at such a distant obligation.  We were still
young, and it seemed that so many years must pass before
the baby on my knee would want a starting hand.  I kissed
the child's little white fingers.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Walter," I said, "you are looking a long, long way
into the future."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my girl; but days happy as ours pass very quickly.
It will not seem so long before we shall be obliged to think
about it.  What shall we do then?  We save no money even
now, you know.  By-and-by we must send these babies to
school; after that they will want money to help them on in
professions.  How are we to do all this?  Our income won't
increase."
</p>

<p>
"We must try and economize," I answered, impressed by
the really serious view he took.
</p>

<p>
"But how?  As it is, we can scarcely make both ends
meet.  I am afraid I am selfish in living as I do.  I have
serious thought of going into some business and trying to
make a fortune."
</p>

<p>
I begged, beseeched him to dismiss the wild idea.  Were
we not happy enough with all we now possessed?  Why
change our mode of life, which was so peaceful and sweet?
Besides, in my heart of hearts I doubted if my good,
easy-going Walter was quite fitted for a commercial career.  He
kissed me as I pleaded eloquently for a continuation of our
present happiness, and for a time the subject dropped.
</p>

<p>
Yet I could see, from remarks he now and again made,
that the thought lingered in his mind, and I began to fear
lest, some day, he might put it into practical shape, when the
anxieties attendant on money-making or money-losing might
be ours.
</p>

<p>
It was some months after our conversation that old Reuben
Dyke, a well-known character in the village of Draycot,
came to the Hall.  He wanted to see the master on important
business, he said.  This old Reuben was the greatest
gossip of the place&mdash;the ale-house oracle&mdash;meddler in
every one's business, and unsolicited adviser-in-general to
the little world around him.  He was a great authority among
the villagers, many of whom would have backed his opinion
against the united wisdom of a Daniel and a Solomon.  His
talk and broad Somerset accent always amused us, and, it
may be, insured him a better reception than his virtues
merited.
</p>

<p>
To-day he entered the room with an indescribable look
of mystery and secrecy on his shrewd old face.  He carefully
closed the door after him and bade us a respectful good-day.
Then, drawing quite close to us, he spoke in guarded
whispers.
</p>

<p>
"I be jest come, zur, to tell 'ee as ther' have a-bin a chap
a staayin' at the Blue Boar vor the last two or dree daays.
Mebby, zur, as you've a zeed un about&mdash;a darkish,
picket-noased zort of a chap."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I saw him," answered Walter.  "What about him?"
</p>

<p>
"Now, look here, zur.  None o' we couldn't at vust miake
out what a wer' up to.  He yent one o' them outrides, you
zee.  He werdn't lookin' aater shopkippers.  He were a
ferretin' about aater land.  Zo we up and ax'd un what a farm
a wer' aater, or if a did want to buy any land hereabouts?
He laughed and zed, zes he, 'We be gwain to make a raailroad
right up droo theese yer valley.'  Zes I, 'I hoap my
head won't yache till we do get a raailwaay on Mendip, vor
that is a devilish poor country.'  'True,' zes he; 'but there be
a lot o' coal jest under&mdash;along Havyat Green and Upper
Langford.'  Zes I, 'Zo I've a-heerd;' and then I zeed in a
minute which waay the cat wer' jumpin'.  He werdn't gwain
to make nar a raailwaay; he wanted to zenk a coal-pit, and
get howld o' zome land under false pretenses.  Zo, if I wer'
you, zur, and if I wer' Mr. Llewellyn, I should jest keep
my eyes open; vor I shouldn't wonder if, one o' thease here
daays, he won't be along and offer 'ee a hundred and fifty
a yacre vor some o' your poorest land.  But my advice to
you, zur, is&mdash;doan't 'ee zell it&mdash;not vor double the money."
</p>

<p>
After this important communication, Reuben bowed himself
out; retiring probably to the kitchen, in order that he
might regale himself with meat and drink and our servants
with the latest village gossip.  Walter and I sat digesting
his news.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if there can be any truth in it," said Walter.
"I'll go down to-morrow and see that fellow at the inn, and
ask him pointblank about it."
</p>

<p>
But on the morrow the fellow at the inn was there no
longer.  He had departed and left no address.  The landlord
only knew him as plain Mr. Smith.  We never saw or heard
of him again&mdash;whatever his errand may have been, it was not
revealed to us; but, nevertheless, old Reuben's conjecture as
to the object of his sojourn at the Blue Boar quite unsettled
Walter's mind.  The thought that untold wealth might
be lying under our very feet was always present to it, and
at last he resolved to employ experts who were competent
to give an opinion on the matter, and settle our hopes and
doubts.
</p>

<p>
So, very soon, we were visited by Captain Thomas Davies,
of Aberfellteg, and Captain Davies Thomas, of Cwmtygwyn,
two gentlemen whose strangely accented English, redundant
with such words as "Inteet" and "Inteet to coodness," was
a source of great amusement and enjoyment to each of us.
They inspected, diagnosed, experimented, and then reported.
My poor dear love! shall I ever forget your excitement, your
joy, as we perused together that glowing joint production?
What wealth you dreamed of and counted up!  Not, I know,
that you wished for riches for your own sake&mdash;it was for the
sake of wife and children that the desire of acquiring a large
fortune obtained such a hold on you.  Ah me! how certain,
how clear and straightforward it all seemed!  Had not the
mining captains calculated, with an accuracy that seemed
infallible, every ton of coal that lay hidden beneath our green
fields?  Did not their figures prove beyond dispute the profit
each ton raised must bring?  After every contingency had
been guarded against, what read like Aladdin's wealth lay
waiting for us to stoop down, take, and enjoy.  Why should
we not do so?
</p>

<p>
Then other gentlemen came to our quiet home&mdash;legal
gentlemen&mdash;gentlemen who were called financiers&mdash;gentlemen
learned, very learned, it seemed to me, in acreages, crops, and
soils.  Old safes were unlocked, old plans and musty deeds
extracted from their recesses.  I heard the word "Mortgage"
frequently; and Walter told me he had resolved to share
his promised wealth with no one.  He would work the
projected mines solely on his own account; but, in order to
begin operations, money was needful; so he had arranged
with the two financial gentlemen, Messrs. Leach and
Vincent, of Bristol, that such sums of money as were necessary
should be advanced to him upon the security of his estate.
And these gentlemen applauded Walter's courageous resolution,
and everything went so pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
Then the digging began!
</p>

<p>
Oh, how I hated it!  From the very first I hated it!  Not
only did it spoil one of our prettiest fields&mdash;the one where
the children gathered earliest cowslips&mdash;but it brought
strange faces and rough forms to the quiet, sleepy little
village.  Men and women of a very different type to that of
laborers round about.  Slatternly untidy women and strong,
surly men who knew not the traditions of the land.  Men
who were supposed to beat their wives once a week, and
who, we knew, played havoc with our neighbors' costly
preserves.  Men who worked hard&mdash;very hard&mdash;and insisted
upon that work being highly paid for&mdash;who spent so large
a proportion of those hard-earned wages in drink, that the
landlords of the opposition village inns actually shook hands
in their unexpected prosperity; whilst our kind, old,
easy-going rector fairly cried at the way in which his new and
unwelcome parishioners were demoralizing the old ones, and
old Reuben Dyke seemed to look almost patronizingly upon
us, as two deserving young people helped to fortune by his
great sagacity and wisdom.
</p>

<p>
So it went on, month after month; yet I saw no signs of
the advent of that promised wealth.  So far as I could
understand it, the seam of coal hit upon by those clever captains
was a failure.  It broke, or dipped, or something else; so
the continuation had to be sought elsewhere.  Thereupon
Captains Thomas Davies and Davies Thomas came over
again, inspected again, and reported so cheerfully that
Walter's face lost that look of anxiety which I had lately seen
upon it, and he pushed on the work more briskly than before.
</p>

<p>
Then they told me the right seam had been found&mdash;Walter
was radiant.  Out of the first money gained he would
send Thomas Davies and Davies Thomas a hundred pounds
apiece, as an extra recognition due to their skill and good
counsel.  Larger sums than before were furnished by our
financial friends, who came to the Hall once or twice, and
were, I thought, very rude and familiar in their manner.
Machinery and engines were erected, more men engaged,
and in time great black heaps began to accumulate, and
grimy black faces met me at every turn.  Our peaceful and
beautiful home was so changed that I began almost to
loathe what had once been the dearest spot on earth to me,
and to long for change of air and scene.
</p>

<p>
Money seemed always being paid away&mdash;large sums that
frightened me.  But was I not only a woman, who knew
nothing of business?
</p>

<p>
Yet all these grievances were nothing to the grief I felt
at seeing the change in my darling's face.  Every week I
noticed an alteration.  Gradually a cloud of care seemed
settling down on his once gay nature, and I knew his mind was
anxious and ill at ease.  He grew thinner; his dark hair
showed signs of premature grayness; his sleep was often
restless and unfreshing.  Though now, as he ever had been,
kind and gentle to me, at times with others he was moody,
silent, and evidently worried.  All the brightness of youth
appeared to be leaving him, so much so that my heart ached
to see him, and I felt I could bear it no longer.  I would
learn the worst he had to tell me, claiming my right
as a true wife to share trouble as well as joy with my
husband.
</p>

<p>
The confidence I was resolved to claim came unasked for.
One evening Walter returned home and threw himself into
a chair, apparently utterly broken down.  He covered his
eyes with his hands and sobbed bitterly.
</p>

<p>
I knelt at his side and my arms were round him.  Then
he told me all&mdash;I need not give the details.  The bare truth
was this: After all the money spent, the coal raised was of
such a poor quality that every ton sold was sold at a loss.
And more money than I had ever imagined had been
expended.  Of course he had been cheated&mdash;I knew he was
being cheated the moment I saw the faces of the men who
had lent him the money he wanted; but there was no help
for it now.  Messrs. Leach and Vincent claimed, for
advances, costs and interest, the enormous sum of close upon
ten thousand pounds.  Walter had just come from Bristol,
where these men carried on business, and after a stormy
interview with them, had been informed that unless the
amount was paid by Saturday, house, lands, and everything
would be at once advertised for sale&mdash;and to-day was
Wednesday!
</p>

<p>
I knew nothing of law; but, even to my ignorance, this
sudden demand and swift procedure seemed unusual.
</p>

<p>
"But can they do it?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am afraid they can.  Months ago, when they made
me a large advance, they gave me notice to pay the mortgage
off.  It was a mere matter of form, they said; but now they
will act upon it.  They are thorough-going rogues, and I
believe have some scheme in their heads by which they fancy
it possible to get absolute possession of the whole estate."
</p>

<p>
"But, Walter dear, the estate must be worth thousands
more than that amount."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I can get the money easily enough.  But not in
three days.  It will cut me to the heart even to see it all
advertised, although doubtless the sale may be stopped."
</p>

<p>
"Why not go to that nice old gentleman, Mr. Mainwaring?"
I suggested.  "You always call him your family
solicitor.  He will help you, I am sure."
</p>

<p>
"That is just what I intend doing.  I shall go to London
to-morrow, and show him exactly how I stand, and beg as
a great favor that I may have the money at once.  When
I return I will give orders for all the men to be discharged
and the machinery sold.  There shall be an end of it before
it makes an end of me."
</p>

<p>
I was almost hysterical with joy as I heard his last words.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my love!" I cried.  "It will all come right with us
yet.  We are after all only half ruined.  We can let the Hall
and go abroad for several years.  Don't trouble about it any
more.  If you could only know how happy I am to think I
shall have you back once again, all to myself as of old, you
would be happy too.  We will live in some quiet French or
Swiss town, and be everything to one another again."
</p>

<p>
So I talked to him and comforted him, until he grew more
composed, and, kissing me, owned that life was still worth
having, even if shorn of half its wealth.
</p>

<p>
That night I slept more happily than I had slept for
months.
</p>

<p>
The morning's post brought a letter from Leach and
Vincent.  It was couched in legal terms, and stated that
unless the amount due was paid in notes or gold by
Saturday at noon, they would take the threatened steps.  Walter
at once despatched a telegram, saying the money would be
paid, and requesting that the necessary release might be
prepared in order to avoid any delay.  Then he started for
London, in quest of ten thousand pounds.
</p>

<p>
I had little fear as to the result of his expedition.  I can
read faces; and long ago I had read in Mr. Mainwaring's
face the kindness of his disposition.  I knew he was rich,
and that his clients were also rich men; moreover, he had a
high opinion of Walter, and held him in what might almost
be termed affection.  When he congratulated me upon my
marriage, he told me, in unmistakable words, what he
thought of my husband.  So I was not surprised when, on
the Friday evening, Walter returned with a semblance of
the old joyous smile on his face; and, after locking a
pocketful of bank-notes in the safe, sat down by me, and for the
rest of the evening built airy castles, or rather cottages, full
of peacefulness and love.
</p>

<p>
When I awoke next morn, my heart was light; trouble, it
seemed, had been, but passed away so swiftly that its traces
scarce remained.  I threw the window open, and the fresh,
sweet air of spring brought gladness on its wings.  The
honeysuckle, old and great, that clothed the wall beneath my
window, just gave signs of breaking into blossom; leaning
out, I plucked some sprays and pinned them in my dress.  A
thrush sung from a bush below; my heart kept echoing his
notes of love and joy.  What cared I for the money, or its loss?
Should I not have my own love back again, and watch his
face regain its old bright look of health and happiness?
Passed by his side, and with our children round, would not
my life be pleasant in some quaint old town of France?  And
we would live so carefully, and save money as years went on,
until some day might bring us to the dear old Hall again.
Unhappy?&mdash;no! few moments in my life had happier been
than these.
</p>

<p>
And Walter was cheerful.  He would soon be out of the
clutches of his obliging friends.  The shock was over.  He
had told me what had been gnawing at his heart for so long;
he was now looking his troubles fairly in the face, and, as
usually happens, found them not so terrible in aspect as he
had imagined.  He buttoned his bank-notes in his breast-pocket
and started for the railway station.  He felt better
and stronger to-day, and, as the morning was so beautifully
fine, was tempted to walk the five miles, instead of driving,
as he usually did.
</p>

<p>
We were early risers, so he had plenty of time, and I
thought the walk would do him good.  Perhaps it was the
feeling of newly restored confidence&mdash;perfect and true&mdash;which
now existed between us that made his farewell to me that
morning even more affectionate than it was wont to be&mdash;made
him insist upon having all the children brought down,
and taking many a kiss from those little rosy pursed-up
lips&mdash;made him pause when he reached the furthest point to
which my eyes could follow him, and turning, waft me one
more farewell.
</p>

<p>
I should have walked with him, at any rate, part of the
way; but household duties had to be attended to; so, after
watching his tall figure disappear at the turning of the drive,
I reentered the house, hoping that the day would pass
quickly, and hasten the evening which would bring him back
again.
</p>

<p>
Months and months ago I had promised a friend, who
sighed in far-away lands for English fields again, to make,
this spring, a little collection of dried ferns and send it to
her.  The anxiety of the last few months had driven the promise
from my mind, but as, this morning, I pictured our own
projected emigration, my thoughts turned to my distant
friend, and my broken promise came back to me.  I
determined that on the first opportunity I would make amends
for my neglect.
</p>

<p>
Ferns, many of them scarce ones, grew plentifully in our
pleasant country; but on the road that Walter must take
on his way to the station they flourished in unusual
abundance.  I could obtain many varieties close at hand, but
some few grew further off; so I asked Walter, if he should
chance to meet with any specimens of these particular sorts,
to pick a frond or two, which he could place between the
leaves of the book he carried.  I wanted, especially, a
specimen of the Northern Shield Fern, which even here is not
very common, growing as it does in little patches, sometimes
miles apart.  He laughed at my idle request, but promised
to attend to it.
</p>

<p>
The day wore on, and the sun got low.  It was time to
send the dog-cart to meet the train.  Long, long before the
time had elapsed in which, by any chance, it could return,
I was waiting at the window to welcome Walter home again.
I waited and waited, until so many weary minutes crawled
away that I was fain to conclude he had been detained in
Bristol until the next and last train.
</p>

<p>
I nursed my disappointment, and killed the time as best I
could.  The hour when I might surely expect him came and
passed.  The train must be late.  I opened the window, and
waited and listened for the sound of his coming.
</p>

<p>
At last I heard the ring of the horse's hoofs, and saw
the approaching dog-cart dimly by the light of the stars.  I
ran to the door, eager to greet my husband; but as the horse
drew up on the gravel, I could see only one figure in the
dog-cart&mdash;that of James, our groom.  He told me that his
master had come by neither train, so, after waiting, he had
driven back alone.
</p>

<p>
I turned away, very miserable and sad at heart, but,
strange to say, felt no fear of evil.  Business had, of course,
detained him.  It seemed unkind not to have let me know
in some way, but perhaps he could find no means of doing
so.  There was not the slightest chance of his returning
to-night, the distance being far too great for driving.  I must
wait until to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
It was only when I went to bed&mdash;alone, for almost the
first time since we were married&mdash;that fear fell upon me,
and fancy brought horrid ideas to my mind&mdash;that the
possibility of evil having befallen my husband came to me.  The
large sum of money he carried, the lonely road, the black-faced
colliers about the neighborhood&mdash;all combined to fill
me with a nameless dread&mdash;a terror which I could scarcely
put into thoughts, much less into words.  Yet I strove with
my fears, trying to strangle each one as it was born.
</p>

<p>
"I shall see him to-morrow.  To-morrow I shall see him,"
I repeated over and over again; and as that morning at last
dawned, I fell into a restless sleep.
</p>

<p>
But morning brought him not; noon brought him not&mdash;neither
letter nor message.  So my heart died within me;
and taking a maid with me, I started for Bristol by the
afternoon train.  It was Sunday; the streets of the large town
looked dreary and deserted as we passed through them.
Knowing Mr. Leach's private address, we drove straight to
his house.  After some delay I was shown into a room.
</p>

<p>
By and by Mr. Leach entered, with his fat forefinger
closed in a book of sermons, which, I felt instinctively, he
had been engaged in reading for the benefit of his young
vultures.  His smooth face was full of gentle astonishment
that any one should wish to confer with him on business
matters on that particular evening in the week.  As I looked
at him and read through his mask of hypocrisy, I knew that
the man was a rogue and capable of committing any crime.
When he saw who his visitor was, his astonished look
changed to one of annoyance.  He closed his book entirely,
laying it on the table with the edifying title turned
toward me.
</p>

<p>
It seems childish to mention such trivial incidents; but
during that terrible time every word, every detail, seems
graven upon my memory in deep lines that will never be
effaced.
</p>

<p>
"I have called, Mr. Leach&mdash;" I began.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Mrs. Linton, I know why you have called.  But
I am sorry to be obliged to say that your errand is
useless&mdash;utterly useless.  Mr. Linton
made a promise he has not kept.
He can not blame us for the steps we have taken."
</p>

<p>
"A promise not kept?" I echoed.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not.  He undertook to pay us a large sum of
money yesterday.  He has not been near us&mdash;I conclude he
fa ill," he added, with an approach to a sneer.
</p>

<p>
I sunk back in the wildest grief.  Then all my fears of the
night, all my forebodings of the day, were true!  I knew that
never&mdash;never again should I look on Walter's face.  He had
been murdered&mdash;but by whom?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Leach endeavored, after the manner of his kind, to
comfort me.  He placed his fat hand in a soothing way upon
my arm.  This action restored my senses to me.
</p>

<p>
"My husband left me only yesterday morning with the
money you claim in his pocket.  I know it for certain.  He
was going straight to you.  Where is he?  Tell me?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Leach gave a start of surprise, but said nothing.  I
waited for his answer.
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?" I reiterated.  "Tell me!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Leach placed his finger-tips together, and looked at
me with an expression almost like placid amusement.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Linton," he said slowly, "I am a man of business,
and have seen strange things in my time, so you mustn't be
offended if I ask you a question.  Mr. Linton had the money
ready for us, you say.  In what form was it?"
</p>

<p>
"In notes, sir," I replied.  "He told me you declined taking
anything else."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes&mdash;except gold.  So we did.  We are bound to be
careful.  Now, Mrs. Linton&mdash;mind, I mean no offense&mdash;do
you know that your husband was much embarrassed?"
</p>

<p>
"I know he could pay all just debts&mdash;and unjust ones,
too," I answered, with rising indignation.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course.  All just and unjust debts.  All unjust
debts&mdash;very good.  Now, do you think it possible&mdash;ten
thousand is a lot of money&mdash;do you think it possible that
Mr. Linton may have&mdash;well, in plain English, decamped with it?"
</p>

<p>
I heard no more.  My face was flaming.  I rose and, without
another word, left the room.  I was in the cab before
Mr. Leach had recovered from his surprise, and in another
minute was sobbing my poor heart out on the shoulder of
my maid&mdash;a faithful, good girl who loved me.
</p>

<p>
I can not tell you of the next few days.  The uncertainty
of everything, yet, to me, the utter hopelessness.  The dread
of what any moment might make known to me.  The searchers
searching and hoping to find&mdash;what?  For I knew that
the success of their quest could only bring me the dead body
of my darling&mdash;murdered, perhaps, for the sake of the money
he carried.  Yet hardest of all to bear was the knowledge
that the sorrow manifested by those around me was only
assumed out of respect to me; that no one believed Walter
to be dead; that the wicked, cruel slander which had framed
itself in Mr. Leach's mind had entered into the minds of
others.  I could read the thought in the faces of all who
came near me during those days.  I knew that the paid seekers
performed their task with a smile on their lips&mdash;that the
word went around among them that, in order to be successful,
the search should be, not for a dead, but for a living
man, to find whom it was needful to look further away.
How was it I did not go mad?
</p>

<p>
I cared nothing when some one told me that the property,
house, and all were advertised for sale in a few weeks' time.
I thought of nothing, saw nothing but the cold, still face of
the one I loved.  I wished for nothing now but to see his
name cleared from the stain thrown upon it&mdash;a stain he
would have heeded more than death; this done, I wished to
die&mdash;that was all.  The wild thought which had at first entered
my head, that the men to whom he owed the money had
taken it and made away with him, was at last dispelled; for
proof was positive that Walter had not gone to Bristol on
that fatal morning.  The passengers from the station were
too few, and Walter too well known not to have been
noticed.  Indeed, no ticket for the class by which he would
certainly have traveled had been issued that day.  No one
had met him that morning, and he had disappeared without
leaving a trace; for people told me that every inch of the
country near had been scoured.  But I knew they deceived
me, and that the wicked thought was in every heart, although
no one dared to speak it in words to me who knew him and
loved him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mainwaring, whom I had almost forgotten in my
grief, came down in the course of a few days.  Unfit as I
was for business, I was compelled to see him.  The kind old
man was in great distress and anxiety, but he was very good
to me.  He started when he saw that I had already put on
mourning.
</p>

<p>
"It is dreadful," he said, with tears in his eyes, and taking
both my hands in his.  "Not that I care for the money so
much&mdash;although, of course, I must make up any deficiency
myself, having been guilty of such irregularity.  It is
dreadful to think that I, who tried to help Walter, must now strip
his wife and children of their last shilling.  I trusted him so
that I let him have my client's money simply on his note-of-hand,
bearing, of course, all responsibility myself.  It was
most irregular; but he was so urgent, and I wanted to help
him.  Poor girl!  I will do what I can for you, but I am
afraid it can be but little."
</p>

<p>
I begged him not to think of us, and thanked him again
and again for his great kindness.
</p>

<p>
"I would, if only in my own interests, pay the money
again and stop the sale; but no one has the power to
mortgage the property to me.  We do not even know that Walter
is dead.  It can not, can not be true, what every one seems
to hint at?" he added, almost shamefacedly.
</p>

<p>
I burst into a flood of tears and almost fell at his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Not you, Mr. Mainwaring!  Not you!" I sobbed out.
"You, who knew him, and knew that dishonor was not in
him!  Let me think that one, at least, believes in my dead
love.  Would to God, for my sake, it were as people think,
so that I might some day see him again."
</p>

<p>
The kind old friend raised me.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said; "I don't believe it.  I have known him
from a boy, and I knew his father before him.  They lie
who say Walter Linton could have done such a thing.  But
it is all very, very dreadful."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mainwaring slept at Draycot Hall that night, but I
could not bring myself to spend the evening in his
company.  We could but think or speak of one subject, and I
felt I had no right to inflict my grief upon him.  I should be
better alone.  I watched the children sink to sleep, and for
some hours sat by their little white beds listening to their
regular breathing.  Then I kissed them all gently and very
quickly, lest my hot tears, falling on their upturned faces,
should awake them; and, near midnight, retired to what
with me would wrongly be called rest.  I locked the door
of my room, undressed myself, and sat in my dressing-gown
over the fire, for the night being damp and cold, my good
maid had kindled a fire for me.
</p>

<p>
And there I sat, not seeking rest.  I knew that sleep and
I must be strangers for hours; that not until my strength
was quite worn out would sad thoughts cease and change to
sadder dreams; not till at last, from sheer fatigue they fell,
would weary eyelids curtain tearful eyes.  And so I sat, till
slowly died the fire, and morning air stole chilly through
the room&mdash;thinking of all the joy and sweetness of life so
lately promised, all it gave me now.  It seemed so hard to
lose the one I loved&mdash;lost, as it were, in darkest night, with
none to say where he had wandered.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" I cried, "if I could see you once and say farewell,
although your words came but from dying lips!  I should
not grieve so much, and for the sake of children dear to both
might live, and even not go mad."
</p>

<p>
The wind had risen with the night, and gusts now and
again bore heavy rain that beat against my window; whilst
the tall trees round moaned as the gale went tearing through
their boughs.  The world seemed full of dismal sounds and
grief, and I the saddest in the world.  At last sleep
conquered sorrow, so I threw myself down on the bed and slept.
How long it was I slept I can not tell, for all the while I
seemed awake and seeing fearful sights.  Cruel voices
whispered words that stabbed my heart, so that in dreams I
longed for wakefulness.  Then I awoke and heard the wind
and rain, louder and fiercer, whilst the room looked strange
as morning dawned in cheerless gray, and crept in through
the half turned blind.
</p>

<p>
I felt dazed.  For a moment I could scarcely realize
where I was, or quite recall what had happened.  I even
turned, from force of habit, to see if Walter, who should
be by my side, was also awake.  Then, as I saw the vacant
pillow by mine, all came back to me&mdash;came back with such
a reflux of sorrow that, in my despair, I threw out my arms,
and sobbing bitterly, called on the one who could not hear
me.  My right hand lay as it had fallen, outside the
coverlid, and, in a minute, I almost shrieked with horror and
alarm; for I felt another hand seek it, touch it; and I
experienced the sensation of fingers closing round my own.
Hastily I tore my hand away from that clasp&mdash;if what held
without restraining, made itself distinctly felt without
offering resistance, can be called a clasp&mdash;and sprang from the
bed.  Courageous as I am by nature, I trembled like a leaf,
and had it been dark when that unknown hand sought mine,
my horror must have vented itself in screams.  But the room
was nearly light; so in a few moments I conquered that
overpowering fright and looked around for the intruder.  I
peered into every nook in which one might possibly hide,
but detected no one.  The door was as firmly locked as I
left it.  I was alone, for no one could have entered either
by door or window.  Then I sat down and reasoned with
myself on my folly.  It was fancy from a mind upset and
overwrought with grief.  It was the lingering impression
left by one of those dreams&mdash;those dreadful dreams which
sleep had brought me!  It was a pure delusion, a creation
of my own, and I wondered if, as I feared at times, I was
going out of my senses.  Although I was able to persuade
myself that this reasoning was correct, I dared not return
to my bed, but, sitting once more in my chair, longed for
broad daylight.
</p>

<p>
My thoughts soon wandered away from my recent fright,
and took that path which they always followed.  My arm
dropped to my side, and my fingers relaxed themselves.  And
then, once more I felt that hand creep to mine, take it, and
hold it.  Again I felt the unmistakable sensation of fingers
that closed round mine.  I felt that there was no hand in mine
that my hand could clasp in return, but the sensation of a
palm against my palm&mdash;fingers twining my fingers&mdash;was
indisputable.  The sensation of pressure was there&mdash;faintly, it
is true, but it was there.  It was no fancy, no dream, this
time.  Whether mortal or not, a hand, or the semblance of a
hand, was holding mine.  Again the horror overcame me&mdash;again
I strove to tear my hand away from this invisible clasp.
My blood curdled as I found the result of my efforts failed on
this second occasion&mdash;found that the fingers which fastened
on my own could not be shaken off, do what I would.  As I
moved my hand, even so the hand that held it moved with it.
If I clinched my own, I could yet feel the strange pressure
of those unseen fingers.  If I grasped my right hand in my
left, there was still the sensation of another hand between
my own.  Do what I would, move how I would, that clasp,
or phantom of a clasp, was ever on my hand.  Yet I struggled
with fear until the awful thought flashed through my
brain that this was the aura, the forerunner of paralysis or
epilepsy.  Then I could bear it no longer.  Whether that
grasp was the result of bodily or mental ailment, I could
bear it no longer&mdash;I felt my mind was going.  I rushed to
the door, tore it open, and my screams rang through the
house.  Remember, I was but a woman, and alone.
</p>

<p>
As the sound of hurrying feet drew near, that hand or
hand-clasp lying on my own quitted it.  Then, as the strange
sensation ceased, did I hear a mournful sound, like a sigh,
or was it only the wind outside?  Did the phantom fingers
draw themselves away from mine soothingly, even, it seemed,
reluctantly, or was that fancy too?  As the servants with
frightened looks drew near me, could that wild and joyful
thought that flashed through my brain be more than the
thought of a madwoman?  What could it mean?
</p>

<p>
Except for this I was myself again.  I had been frightened,
I told all who came to me&mdash;frightened by dreams, by
shadows, by solitude, and my own thoughts.  No one wondered
at it; what flesh and blood could stand, unmoved, the
anxiety I had borne during the last week?  I was over-wrought
and suffering from sleeplessness, so Mr. Mainwaring
insisted upon giving me an opiate.  I swallowed it reluctantly,
and my maid sat with me, until, in due time, dull sleep
told of the potency and efficacy of the drug which I had been
made to take.
</p>

<p>
This artificial sleep lasted without a break until late in the
afternoon.  Then I awoke refreshed, and in full possession of
my senses.  I arose and prayed, as I had never prayed before,
that my hand might again feel that unseen touch which had
nearly driven me mad in the night.  "Will it come again?
O, let it come again!" was the constant cry of my heart;
and I longed ardently for the night, which, perhaps, might
bring that hand seeking my own again.  For incredible as it
seems, I knew, when those fingers last left mine, that love
had in part conquered death&mdash;that Walter had been with me.
Now I feared nothing.  Why should I fear?  He had loved
me living&mdash;he loved me now.  Whether he came to me in
body or in spirit, should he not be welcome?  Oh, that he
might come again!
</p>

<p>
And he came again.  Mr. Mainwaring, who would not
leave Draycot that day on account of the apparently strange
state of my health, that evening insisted upon my taking a
turn in the garden.  I obeyed him, although every plant, every
blossom around, seemed breathing sadness.  I was too tired
to walk for longer than a few minutes, but sat on my favorite
seat, and watched the sun sink behind the hills.  Even then
and there&mdash;in broad daylight&mdash;I felt his hand seek my own,
and my heart leaped with joy.  I shunned or strove to avoid
it no longer.  I let my hand lie still, and again I felt the
touch, or the spirit of the touch, of the one I loved.  So
naturally those fingers closed round mine; so familiar seemed that
clasp to me, that could I have forgotten the last week, I might
have closed my eyes, and, lying there with my hand in his,
have thought I had only to open them to happiness once
more.  If I could but forget!
</p>

<p>
Even if I had not known in whose hand mine was resting,
the caress those fingers gave me would have told me.
I wondered why I feared and repulsed them at first.  If only
I could sometimes sit as I sat then, and know and feel that
Walter was beside me, I thought that life might even be
happy.  So I turned my head toward him, and said,
softly&mdash;so softly:
</p>

<p>
"Dearest love, you will come often and often, will you
not?  You will be always with me; then I shall not be
unhappy."
</p>

<p>
He answered not, but I felt a change in the clasp of his
hand, and I pondered as to what its meaning could be.  Then
I fancied that faintly, very faintly, that touch was
endeavoring to make me understand something which my grosser
earthly faculties failed to grasp&mdash;to direct, to lead me
somewhere for some purpose.  For it left me and came again, left
and came again, till at last I learned its meaning.
</p>

<p>
Then and there I rose.  "I come, my love," I said.  And
once more Walter Linton and his wife walked, as they had
walked many a time before, hand-in-hand down the broad
garden path; past the rustic lodge, covered with rosebuds
and woodbine; through the gateway; out into the high road.
I feared nothing: the hand of the one I loved was in mine,
and guiding me whither he chose; moreover it was yet
daylight, and I was not dreaming.
</p>

<p>
I even knew that Mr. Mainwaring followed us as we
walked down the path.  I saw him come to my side and look
at me with wonder.  I wanted no one to be near my husband
and myself, so I waved him back imperiously.  "Follow if
you like," I said, "but do not speak to us."  Perhaps he
thought I was mad, perhaps that I was walking in my sleep,
and, if so, feared to awake me.  Any way, he followed us
silently, and that was all I knew or cared about him, or about
anything else.  For were not my love and I walking, once
more, hand-in-hand, and it was not in a dream?
</p>

<p>
Along and along the road, each side of which is beautiful
with its green banks and hedges, and every inch of which we
know, even keeping to that side we always choose because the
flowers grow thickest there.  How fresh and green everything
looks this evening!  The swallows are flying here and there.
Every blade of grass is washed clean from dust by the heavy
rain of the morning.  No.  I am not dreaming.  I am walking
with my husband.  A nightingale breaks Into song near
us, as we walk.  We stop&mdash;who could help stopping to listen?
Now its melody ceases, and Walter leads me on.  It is like
in the old days when we were first wed; before we thought
or wished for more wealth.  Those days when all the country
round was fresh and new to me.  Never did the wild-flowers,
I think, look gayer than they look this evening, although they
are closing fast.  I would stop, my darling, and gather a
bunch for the children; but they have so many flowers at
home, and I fear to loose your hand for a moment.  Besides,
you wish to lead me further yet; we have somewhere to go
to this evening.  I forget whither it was you told me, Walter.
Is it to the lily-pond, to see if we can find any snow-white
cups floating, buoyed up by the broad green leaves?  Is it
to climb the hill that lies in front of us, and see the very
last of the glorious sun; to catch the crimson sparkle of its
rays on the distant windows of our dear home?  That sun
which will rise to-morrow, and waken us both so early&mdash;for
you will never leave me again, Walter&mdash;promise me, my
darling&mdash;I have been so unhappy.  Is it further yet?  To the ruins
of the gray old abbey where the poet's ivy grows so freely?
Shall we wait there, as once before, and see the full moon
shine through the rose of the east windows?  Shall we wander
arm-in-arm through the dim glades, laughing at the foolish
monks who chose to live and die there, knowing not love, nor
the sweetness of life when two share its joys and troubles?
But our troubles are over now, are they not, dearest?  No
matter, lead me whither you will: I care not&mdash;you are with
me, your hand is in mine, and I am happy.  But wherever
we go, we will walk back by moonlight, and then creep up
quietly and kiss the children just once before we go to bed.
To-morrow we will wake and love again.  No, I am not
dreaming.  But why do you not speak to me and tell me
where you have been&mdash;why you left me so long?  Oh, how I
have wept and waited for you!  Dearest, you will never leave
me again?
</p>

<p>
This is the spot you wished to lead me to&mdash;the place where
the ferns grow?  Ah, you remembered what I wanted.  Are
there any of that sort up there?  Let us go and see, although
the day is flying fast.  Through the hazel bushes&mdash;deep, deep
into the underwood&mdash;on and on&mdash;up and up&mdash;brambles and
stones!  I did not know it was so steep here.  Hold my
hand firmer and help me.  More bushes, more undergrowth;
and how the twilight fades!  My darling, we shall find no
ferns to-night.  May we not go back and come again to-morrow?
Yet on, and on!  Love, where you lead I follow and
fear not!  Is not your hand in mine, and you will never leave
me again!  Still on!  My darling, you have brought me to
the very edge of a rock!  Don't leave me here!  Don't draw
your hand from mine!  Stay one minute&mdash;one moment
longer!  I can not see you; it is dark and cold!  I can not
feel you, and the world seems filling again with grief.  Come
back!  Come back!  Walter!  Walter!
</p>

<p>
They told me I dreamed it&mdash;that I walked in my sleep.
Clever and learned men said so, and I am only a woman,
neither clever nor learned.  Mr. Mainwaring, who had with
great difficulty followed us&mdash;for I say "us," in spite of all
that wisdom can urge&mdash;found me lying lifeless at the brink
of the rocky depth to which Walter had led me, and where
he had left me.  Down below me lay something that I, thank
God, never saw.  They bore it home and told me it was all
that was left of Walter Linton, my husband.  But I knew
better, for had he not that evening walked hand-in-hand
with me for miles?  They told me, also, that he had fallen
from the top of the rock&mdash;that it was not a great height, but
high enough for the fall to kill him instantaneously&mdash;that
most likely he was led to that fatal place, seeking some rare
plant; as a root and withered leaves were clenched in his
hand&mdash;that the notes he had placed in his pocket when he
left his home were still there&mdash;that Draycot was still mine
and his children's.  But they believe me not when I tell them
that my love, my husband, through the power of the love
he bore me, could come from the dead&mdash;could take my hand
In his and lead me with him, on and on, till he showed me
where and how he died&mdash;till he saved those he loved from
utter ruin and a life of penury&mdash;till, more than all, he cleared
his own dear memory from stain and dishonor.  Yet these
things were!

THRAWN JANET
</p>

<p class="t3">
By ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON
</p>

<p>
The Reverend Murdoch Soulis was long minister of
the moorland parish of Balweary, in the vale of
Dule.  A severe, bleak-faced old man, dreadful to
his hearers, he dwelt in the last years of his life,
without relative or servant or any human company, in the
small and lonely manse under the Hanging Shaw.  In spite
of the iron composure of his features, his eye was wild,
scared, and uncertain; and when he dwelt, in private admonitions,
on the future of the impenitent, it seemed as if his
eye pierced through the storms of time to the terrors of
eternity.  Many young persons, coming to prepare
themselves against the season of the Holy Communion, were
dreadfully affected by his talk.  He had a sermon on 1st
Peter, v. and 8th, "The devil as a roaring lion," on the
Sunday after every seventeenth of August, and he was
accustomed to surpass himself upon that text both by the
appalling nature of the matter and the terror of his bearing in
the pulpit.  The children were frightened into fits, and the
old looked more than usually oracular, and were, all that
day, full of those hints that Hamlet deprecated.  The manse
itself, where it stood by the water of Dule among some
thick trees, with the Shaw overhanging it on the one side,
and on the other many cold, moorish hilltops rising toward
the sky, had begun, at a very early period of Mr. Soulis's
ministry, to be avoided in the dusk hours by all who valued
themselves upon their prudence; and guidmen sitting at the
clachan alehouse shook their heads together at the thought
of passing late by that uncanny neighborhood.  There was
one spot, to be more particular, which was regarded with
especial awe.  The manse stood between the high road and
the water of Dule, with a gable to each; its back was toward
the kirktown of Balweary, nearly half a mile away; in front
of it, a bare garden, hedged with thorn, occupied the land
between the river and the road.  The house was two stories
high, with two large rooms on each.  It opened not directly
on the garden, but on a causewayed path, or passage,
giving on the road on the one hand, and closed on the other
by the tall willows and elders that bordered on the stream.
And it was this strip of causeway that enjoyed among the
young parishioners of Balweary so infamous a reputation.
The minister walked there often after dark, sometimes
groaning aloud in the instancy of his unspoken prayers; and when
he was from home, and the manse door was locked, the
more daring schoolboys ventured, with beating hearts, to
"follow my leader" across that legendary spot.
</p>

<p>
This atmosphere of terror, surrounding, as it did, a man
of God of spotless character and orthodoxy, was a common
cause of wonder and subject of inquiry among the few
strangers who were led by chance or business into that
unknown, outlying country.  But many even of the people of
the parish were ignorant of the strange events which had
marked the first year of Mr. Soulis's ministrations; and among
those who were better informed, some were naturally
reticent, and others shy of that particular topic.  Now and
again, only, one of the older folk would warm into courage
over his third tumbler, and recount the cause of the
minister's strange looks and solitary life.
</p>

<p class="thought">
. . . . . . . . . . . .
</p>

<p>
Fifty years syne, when Mr. Soulis cam' first into Ba'weary,
he was still a young man&mdash;a callant, the folk said&mdash;fu' o'
book learnin' and grand at the exposition, but, as was
natural in sae young a man, wi' nae leevin' experience in
religion.  The younger sort were greatly taken wi' his gifts
and his gab; but auld, concerned, serious men and women
were moved even to prayer for the young man, whom they
took to be a self-deceiver, and the parish that was like to
be sae ill-supplied.  It was before the days o' the
moderates&mdash;weary fa' them; but ill things are like guid&mdash;they baith
come bit by bit, a pickle at a time; and there were folk even
then that said the Lord had left the college professors to
their ain devices, an' the lads that went to study wi' them
wad hae done mair and better sittin' in a peat-bog, like their
forebears of the persecution, wi' a Bible under their oxter
and a speerit o' prayer in their heart.  There was nae doubt,
onyway, but that Mr. Soulis had been ower lang at the
college.  He was careful and troubled for mony things besides
the ae thing needful.  He had a feck o' books wi' him&mdash;mair
than had ever been seen before in a' that presbytery; and a
sair wark the carrier had wi' them, for they were a' like to
have smoored in the Deil's Hag between this and Kilmackerlie.
They were books o' divinity, to be sure, or so they
ca'd them; but the serious were o' opinion there was little
service for sae mony, when the hail o' God's Word would
gang in the neuk of a plaid.  Then he wad sit half the day
and half the nicht forbye, which was scant decent&mdash;writin',
nae less; and first, they were feared he wad read his sermons;
and syne it proved he was writin' a book himsel', which way
surely no fittin' for ane of his years an' sma' experience.
</p>

<p>
Onyway it behooved him to get an auld, decent wife to
keep the manse for him an' see to his bit denners; and he
was recommended to an auld limmer&mdash;Janet M'Clour, they
ca'd her&mdash;and sae far left to himsel' as to be ower persuaded.
There was mony advised him to the contrar, for Janet was
mair than suspeckit by the best folk in Ba'weary.  Lang or
that, she had had a wean to a dragoon; she hadnae come
forrit for maybe thretty year; and bairns had seen her
mumblin' to hersel' up on Key's Loan in the gloamin', whilk was
an unco time an' place for a God-fearin' woman.  Howsoever,
it was the laird himsel' that had first tauld the minister
o' Janet; and in thae days he wad have gane a far gate to
pleesure the laird.  When folk tauld him that Janet was sib
to the deil, it was a' superstition by his way of it; an' when
they cast up the Bible to him an' the witch of Endor, he wad
threep it doun their thrapples that thir days were a' gane by,
and the deil was mercifully restrained.
</p>

<p>
Weel, when it got about the clachan that Janet M'Clour
was to be servant at the manse, the folk were fair mad wi'
her an' him thegether; and some o' the guidwives had nae
better to dae than get round her door cheeks and chairge
her wi' a' that was ken't again her, frae the sodger's bairn
to John Tamson's twa kye.  She was nae great speaker; folk
usually let her gang her ain gate, an' she let them gang
theirs, wi' neither Fair-guid-een nor Fair-guid-day; but when
she buckled to she had a tongue to deave the miller.  Up
she got, an' there wasnae an auld story in Ba'weary but she
gart somebody lowp for it that day; they couldnae say ae
thing but she could say twa to it; till, at the hinder end, the
guidwives up and claught haud of her, and clawed the coats
aff her back, and pu'd her doun the clachan to the water o'
Dule, to see if she were a witch or no, soum or droun.  The
carline skirled till ye could hear her at the Hangin' Shaw,
and she focht like ten; there was mony a guidwife bure the
mark of her neist day, an' mony a lang day after; and just
in the hettest o' the collteshangie, wha suld come up (for
his sins) but the new minister.
</p>

<p>
"Women," said he (and he had a grand voice), "I charge
you in the Lord's name to let her go."
</p>

<p>
Janet ran to him&mdash;she was fair wud wi' terror&mdash;an' clang
to him an' prayed him, for Christ's sake, save her frae the
cummers; an' they, for their pairt, tauld him a' that was
ken't, and maybe mair.
</p>

<p>
"Woman," says he to Janet, "is this true?"
</p>

<p>
"As the Lord sees me," says she, "as the Lord made me,
no a word o't.  Forbye the bairn," says she, "I've been a
decent woman a' my days."
</p>

<p>
"Will you," says Mr. Soulis, "in the name of God, and
before me, His unworthy minister, renounce the devil and
his works?"
</p>

<p>
Weel, it wad appear that when he askit that, she gave a
girn that fairly frichtit them that saw her, an' they could
hear her teeth play dirl thegether in her chafts; but there
was naething for it but the ae way or the ither; an' Janet
lifted up her hand and renounced the deil before them a'.
</p>

<p>
"And now," said Mr. Soulis to the guidwives, "home with
ye, one and all, and pray to God for His forgiveness."
</p>

<p>
And he gied Janet his arm, though she had little on her
but a sark, and took her up the clachan to her ain door like
a leddy of the land; an' her scrieghin' and laughin' as was
a scandal to be heard.
</p>

<p>
There were mony grave folk lang ower their prayers that
nicht; but when the morn cam' there was sic a fear fell upon
a' Ba'weary that the bairns hid theirsels, and even the
men-folk stood and keekit frae their doors.  For there was Janet
comin' doun the clachan&mdash;her or her likeness, nane could
tell&mdash;wi' her neck thrawn, and her heid on ae side, like a
body that has been hangit, and a girn on her face like an
unstreakit corp.  By an' by they got used wi' it, and even
speered at her to ken what was wrang; but frae that day
forth she couldnae speak like a Christian woman, but slavered
and played click wi' her teeth like a pair o' shears; and
frae that day forth the name o' God cam' never on her lips.
Whiles she wad try to say it, but it michtnae be.  Them
that kenned best said least; but they never gied that Thing
the name o' Janet M'Clour; for the auld Janet, by their way
o't, was in muckle hell that day.  But the minister was
neither to haud nor to bind; he preached about naething
but the folk's cruelty that had gi'en her a stroke of the palsy;
he skelpt the bairns that meddled her; and he had her up to
the manse that same nicht and dwalled there a' his lane wi'
her under the Hangin' Shaw.
</p>

<p>
Weel, time gaed by: and the idler sort commenced to
think mair lichtly o' that black business.  The minister was
weel thocht o'; he was aye late at the writing, folk wad see
his can'le doun by the Dule water after twal' at e'en; and
he seemed pleased wi' himsel' and upsitten as at first, though
a' body could see that he was dwining.  As for Janet she
cam' an' she gaed; if she didnae speak muckle afore, it was
reason she should speak less then; she meddled naebody;
but she was an eldritch thing to see, an' nane wad hae
mistrysted wi' her for Ba'weary glebe.
</p>

<p>
About the end o' July there cam' a spell o' weather, the
like o't never was in that countryside; it was lown an' het
an' heartless; the herds couldnae win up the Black Hill, the
bairns were ower weariet to play; an' yet it was gousty too,
wi' claps o' het wund that rumm'led in the glens, and bits
o' shouers that sleekened naething.  We aye thocht it but
to thun'er on the morn; but the morn cam', and the morn's
morning, and it was aye the same uncanny weather, sair on
folks and bestial.  Of a' that were the waur, nane suffered
like Mr. Soulis; he could neither sleep nor eat, he tauld his
elders; an' when he wasnae writin' at his weary book, he wad
be stravaguin' ower a' the countryside like a man possessed,
when a' body else was blythe to keep caller ben the house.
</p>

<p>
Abune Hangin' Shaw, in the bield o' the Black Hill,
there's a bit inclosed grund wi' an iron yett; and it seems,
in the auld days, that was the kirkyaird o' Ba'weary, and
consecrated by the Papists before the blessed licht shone
upon the kingdom.  It was a great howff o' Mr. Soulis's,
onyway; there he would sit an' consider his sermons; and
indeed it's a bieldy bit.  Weel, as he cam' ower the wast end
o' the Black Hill, ae day, he saw first twa, an' syne fower,
an' syne seeven corbie craws fleein' round an' round abune
the auld kirkyaird.  They flew laigh and heavy, an' squawked
to ither as they gaed; and it was clear to Mr. Soulis that
something had put them frae their ordinar.  He wasnae easy
fleyed, an' gaed straucht up to the wa's; an' what suld he
find there but a man, or the appearance of a man, sittin' in
the inside upon a grave.  He was of a great stature, an'
black as hell, and his e'en were singular to see.  Mr. Soulis
had heard tell o' black men, mony's the time; but there was
something unco about this black man that daunted him.
Het as he was, he took a kind o' cauld grue in the marrow
o' his banes; but up he spak for a' that; an' says he: "My
friend, are you a stranger in this place?"  The black man
answered never a word; he got upon his feet, an' begude
to hirsle to the wa' on the far side; but he aye lookit at
the minister; an' the minister stood an' lookit back; till a'
in a meenute the black man was ower the wa' an' rinnin'
for the bield o' the trees.  Mr. Soulis, he hardly kenned why,
ran after him; but he was sair forjaskit wi' his walk an' the
het, unhalesome weather; and rin as he likit, he got nae
mair than a glisk o' the black man amang the birks, till he
won doun to the foot o' the hillside, an' there he saw him
ance mair, gaun, hap, step, an' lowp, ower Dule water to
the manse.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Soulis wasnae weel pleased that this fearsome gangrel
suld mak' sae free wi' Ba'weary manse; an' he ran the
harder, an', wet shoon, ower the burn, an' up the walk; but
the deil a black man was there to see.  He stepped out upon
the road, but there was naebody there; he gaed a' ower the
gairden, but na, nae black man.  At the hinder end, and a
bit feared as was but natural, he lifted the hasp and into the
manse; and there was Janet M'Clour before his een, wi' her
thrawn craig, and nane sae pleased to see him.  And he aye
minded sinsyne, when first he set his een upon her, he had
the same cauld and deidly grue.
</p>

<p>
"Janet," says he, "have you seen a black man?"
</p>

<p>
"A black man?" quo' she.  "Save us a'!  Ye're no wise,
minister.  There's nae black man in a' Ba'weary."
</p>

<p>
But she didnae speak plain, ye maun understand; but
yam-yammered, like a powney wi' the bit in its moo.
</p>

<p>
"Weel," says he, "Janet, if there was nae black man, I
have spoken with the Accuser of the Brethren."
</p>

<p>
And he sat down like ane wi' a fever, an' his teeth
chittered in his heid.
</p>

<p>
"Hoots," says she, "think shame to yoursel', minister;"
an' gied him a drap brandy that she keept aye by her.
</p>

<p>
Syne Mr. Soulis gaed into his study amang a' his books.
It's a lang, laigh, mirk chalmer, perishin' cauld in winter,
an' no very dry even in the tap o' the simmer, for the manse
stands near the burn.  Sae doun he sat, and thocht of a' that
had come an' gane since he was in Ba'weary, an' his hame,
an' the days when he was a bairn an' ran daffin' on the
braes; and that black man aye ran in his heid like the
owercome of a sang.  Aye the mair he thocht, the mair he thocht
o' the black man.  He tried the prayer, an' the words wouldnae
come to him; an' he tried, they say, to write at his book,
but he couldnae mak' nae mair o' that.  There was whiles
he thocht the black man was at his oxter, an' the swat stood
upon him cauld as well-water; and there was other whiles,
when he cam' to himsel' like a christened bairn and minded
naething.
</p>

<p>
The upshot was that he gaed to the window an' stood
glowrin' at Dule water.  The trees are unco thick, an' the
water lies deep an' black under the manse; an' there was
Janet washin' the cla'es wi' her coats kilted.  She had her
back to the minister, an' he, for his pairt, hardly kenned
what he was lookin' at.  Syne she turned round, an' shawed
her face; Mr. Soulis had the same cauld grue as twice that
day afore, an' it was borne in upon him what folk said, that
Janet was deid lang syne, an' this was a bogle in her clay
cauld flesh.  He drew back a pickle and he scanned her
narrowly.  She was tramp-trampin' in the cla'es, croonin' to
hersel'; and eh! Gude guide us, but it was a fearsome face.
Whiles she sang louder, but there was nae man born o'
woman that could tell the words o' her sang; an' whiles
she lookit side-lang doun, but there was naething there for
her to look at.  There gaed a scunner through the flesh upon
his banes; and that was Heeven's advertisement.  But Mr. Soulis
just blamed himsel', he said, to think sae ill of a puir,
auld afflicted wife that hadnae a freend forby himsel'; and
he put up a bit prayer for him and her, an' drank a little
caller water&mdash;for his heart rose again the meat&mdash;an' gaed up
to his naked bed in the gloaming.
</p>

<p>
That was a nicht that has never been forgotten in
Ba'weary, the nicht o' the seeventeenth of August, seeventeen
hun'er' and twal'.  It had been het afore, as I hae said, but
that nicht it was hetter than ever.  The sun gaed doun
amang unco-lookin' clouds; it fell as mirk as the pit; no a
star, no a breath o' wund; ye couldnae see your han' afore
your face, and even the auld folk cuist the covers frae their
beds and lay pechin' for their breath.  Wi' a' that he had
upon his mind, it was gey and unlikely Mr. Soulis wad get
muckle sleep.  He lay an' he tummled; the gude, caller bed
that he got into brunt his very banes; whiles he slept, and
whiles he waukened; whiles he heard the time o' nicht,
and whiles a tyke yowlin' up the muir, as if somebody was
deid; whiles he thocht he heard bogles claverin' in his
lug, an' whiles he saw spunkies in the room.  He behooved,
he judged, to be sick; an' sick he was&mdash;little he
jaloosed the sickness.
</p>

<p>
At the hinder end, he got a clearness in his mind, sat up
in his sark on the bedside, and fell thinkin' ance mair o' the
black man an' Janet.  He couldnae weel tell how&mdash;maybe it
was the cauld to his feet&mdash;but it cam' in upon him wi' a
spate that there was some connection between thir twa, an'
that either or baith o' them were bogles.  And just at that
moment, in Janet's room, which was neist to his, there cam'
a stramp o' feet as if men were wars'lin', an' then a loud
bang; an' then a wund gaed reishling round the fower
quarters of the house; an' then a' was aince mair as seelent
as the grave.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Soulis was feared for neither man nor deevil.  He
got his tinder box, an' lighted a can'le, an' made three steps
o't ower to Janet's door.  It was on the hasp, an' he pushed
it open, an' keeked bauldly in.  It was a big room, as big as
the minister's ain, an' plenished wi' grand, auld, solid gear,
for he had naething else.  There was a fower-posted bed wi'
auld tapestry; and a braw cabinet of aik, that was fu' o' the
minister's divinity books, an' put there to be out o' the
gate; an' a wheen duds o' Janet's lying here and there about
the floor.  But nae Janet could Mr. Soulis see; nor ony sign
of a contention.  In he gaed (an' there's few that wad ha'e
followed him) an' lookit a' round, an' listened.  But there
was naethin' to be heard, neither inside the manse nor in a'
Ba'weary parish, an' naethin' to be seen but the muckle
shadows turnin' round the can'le.  An' then a' at aince, the
minister's heart played dunt an' stood stock-still; an' a cauld
wund blew amang the hairs o' his heid.  Whaten a weary
sicht was that for the puir man's een!  For there was Janet
hangin' frae a nail beside the auld aik cabinet: her heid aye
lay on her shoother, her een were steeked, the tongue projekit
frae her mouth, and her heels were twa feet clear abune
the floor.
</p>

<p>
"God forgive us all!" thocht Mr. Soulis; "poor Janet's
dead."
</p>

<p>
He cam' a step nearer to the corp; an' then his heart
fair whammled in his inside.  For by what cantrip it wad
ill-beseem a man to judge, she was hingin' frae a single
nail an' by a single wursted thread for darnin' hose.
</p>

<p>
It's an awfu' thing to be your lane at nicht wi' siccan
prodigies o' darkness; but Mr. Soulis was strong in the
Lord.  He turned an' gaed his ways oot o' that room, and
lockit the door ahint him; and step by step, doon the stairs,
as heavy as leed; and set doon the can'le on the table at the
stairfoot.  He couldnae pray, he couldnae think, he was
dreepin' wi' caul' swat, an' naething could he hear but the
dunt-dunt-duntin' o' his ain heart.  He micht maybe have
stood there an hour, or maybe twa, he minded sae little;
when a' o' a sudden he heard a laigh, uncanny steer upstairs;
a foot gaed to an' fro in the cha'mer whaur the corp was
hingin'; syne the door was opened, though he minded weel
that he had lockit it; an' syne there was a step upon the
landin', an' it seemed to him as if the corp was lookin' ower
the rail and doun upon him whaur he stood.
</p>

<p>
He took up the can'le again (for he couldnae want the
licht) and, as saftly as ever he could, gaed straucht out o' the
manse an' to the far end o' the causeway.  It was aye pit-mirk;
the flame o' the can'le, when he set it on the grund,
brunt steedy and clear as in a room; naething moved, but the
Dule water seepin' and sabbin' doon the glen, an' yon unhaly
footstep that cam' ploddin' doun the stairs inside the manse.
He kenned the foot ower weel, for it was Janet's; and at
ilka step that cam' a wee thing nearer, the cauld got deeper
in his vitals.  He commended his soul to Him that made an'
keepit him; "and O Lord," said he, "give me strength this
night to war against the powers of evil."
</p>

<p>
By this time the foot was comin' through the passage
for the door; he could hear a hand skirt alang the wa', as if
the fearsome thing was feelin' for its way.  The saughs
tossed an' maned thegether, a lang sigh cam' ower the hills,
the flame o' the can'le was blawn aboot; an' there stood the
corp of Thrawn Janet, wi' her grogram goun an' her black
mutch, wi' the heid aye upon the shouther, an' the girn still
upon the face o't&mdash;leevin', ye wad hae said&mdash;deid, as
Mr. Soulis weel kenned&mdash;upon the threshold o' the manse.
</p>

<p>
It's a strange thing that the saul of man should be that
thirled into his perishable body; but the minister saw that,
an' his heart didnae break.
</p>

<p>
She didnae stand there lang; she began to move again
an' cam' slowly toward Mr. Soulis whaur he stood under the
saughs.  A' the life o' his body, a' the strength o' his speerit,
were glowerin' frae his een.  It seemed she was gaun to
speak, but wanted words, an' made a sign wi' the left hand.
There cam' a clap o' wund, like a cat's fuff; oot gaed the
can'le, the saughs skrieghed like folk; an' Mr. Soulis kenned
that, live or die, this was the end o't.
</p>

<p>
"Witch, beldame, devil!" he cried, "I charge you, by the
power of God, begone&mdash;if you be dead, to the grave&mdash;if
you be damned, to hell."
</p>

<p>
An' at that moment the Lord's ain hand out o' the
Heevens struck the Horror whaur it stood; the auld, deid,
desecrated corp o' the witch-wife, sae lang keepit frae the
grave and hirsled round by deils, lowed up like a brunstane
spunk and fell in ashes to the grund; the thunder followed,
peal on dirling peal, the rairing rain upon the back o' that;
and Mr. Soulis lowped through the garden hedge, and ran,
wi' skelloch upon skelloch, for the clachan.
</p>

<p>
That same mornin', John Christie saw the Black Man
pass the Muckle Cairn as it was chappin' six; before eicht,
he gaed by the change-house at Knockdow; an' no lang after,
Sandy M'Lellan saw him gaun linkin' doun the braes frae
Kilmackerlie.  There's little doubt but it was him that
dwalled sae lang in Janet's body; but he was awa' at last;
and sinsyne the deil has never fashed us in Ba'weary.
</p>

<p>
But it was a sair dispensation for the minister; lang, lang
he lay ravin' in his bed; and frae that hour to this, he was
the man ye ken the day.

so strikingly the humorous and pathetic in
human character.  Much of Dickens's reputation
for ability in this direction is due to his
success with the particular story given

STAVE ONE
</p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Marley's Ghost</i>
</p>

<p>
Marley was dead: to begin with.  There is no doubt
whatever about that.  The register of his burial was
signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,
and the chief mourner.  Scrooge signed it: and
Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he
chose to put his hand to.  Old Marley was dead as a
doornail.
</p>

<p>
Mind!  I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge,
what there is particularly dead about a door-nail.  I
might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as
the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade.  But the
wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed
hands shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for.  You
will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley
was dead as a door-nail.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge knew he was dead?  Of course he did.  How
could it be otherwise?  Scrooge and he were partners for
I don't know how many years.  Scrooge was his sole executor,
his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary
legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner.  And even Scrooge
was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he
was an excellent man of business on the very day of the
funeral, and solemnized it with an undoubted bargain.
</p>

<p>
The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the
point I started from.  There is no doubt that Marley was
dead.  This must be distinctly understood, or nothing
wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate.  If we
were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's Father died
before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable
in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon
his own ramparts, than there would be in any other
middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy
spot&mdash;say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance&mdash;literally to
astonish his son's weak mind.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.  There it
stood, years afterward, above the warehouse door: Scrooge
and Marley.  The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley.
Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge
Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both
names: it was all the same to him.
</p>

<p>
Oh!  But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone,
Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching,
covetous, old sinner!  Hard and sharp as flint, from which
no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and
self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.  The cold within him
froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shriveled his
cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips
blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice.  A frosty
rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry
chin.  He carried his own low temperature always about
with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw
it one degree at Christmas.
</p>

<p>
External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge.
No warmth could warm, nor wintry weather chill him.  No
wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was
more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open
to entreaty.  Foul weather didn't know where to have
him.  The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet,
could boast of the advantage over him in only one
respect.  They often "came down" handsomely, and Scrooge
never did.
</p>

<p>
Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with
gladsome looks, "My dear Scrooge, how are you?  When will
you come to see me?"  No beggars implored him to bestow a
trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or
woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and
such a place, of Scrooge.  Even the blind men's dogs
appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on,
would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and
then would wag their tails as though they said, "No eye at
all is better than an evil eye, dark master!"
</p>

<p>
But what did Scrooge care?  It was the very thing he
liked.  To edge his way along the crowded paths of life,
warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what
the knowing ones call "nuts" to Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
Once upon a time&mdash;of all the good days in the year, on
Christmas Eve&mdash;old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house.
It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he
could hear the people in the court outside go wheezing up
and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and
stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them.  The
city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark
already: it had not been light all day: and candles were
flaring in the windows of the neighboring offices, like ruddy
smears upon the palpable brown air.  The fog came pouring
in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without,
that although the court was of the narrowest, the houses
opposite were mere phantoms.  To see the dingy cloud
come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have
thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a
large scale.
</p>

<p>
The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he
might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little
cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters.  Scrooge
had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was so very much
smaller that it looked like one coal.  But he couldn't
replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and
so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master
predicted that it would be necessary for them to part.
Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried
to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a
man of a strong imagination, he failed.
</p>

<p>
"A merry Christmas, uncle!  God save you!" cried a
cheerful voice.  It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who
came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation
he had of his approach.
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" said Scrooge, "humbug!"
</p>

<p>
He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog
and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a
glow; his face was ruddy and handsome!  his eyes sparkled,
and his breath smoked again.
</p>

<p>
"Christmas a humbug, uncle!" said Scrooge's nephew.
"You don't mean that, I am sure."
</p>

<p>
"I do," said Scrooge.  "Merry Christmas!  What right
have you to be merry?  What reason have you to be merry?
You're poor enough."
</p>

<p>
"Come, then," returned the nephew gaily.  "What right
have you to be dismal?  What reason have you to be
morose?  You're rich enough."
</p>

<p>
Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of
the moment, said "Bah!" again; and followed it up with
"Humbug!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be cross, uncle," said the nephew.
</p>

<p>
"What else can I be," returned the uncle, "when I live
in such a world of fools as this?  Merry Christmas!  Out
upon merry Christmas!  What's Christmas time to you but
a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding
yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for
balancing your books and having every item in 'em through
a round dozen of months presented dead against you?  If
I could work my will," said Scrooge indignantly, "every
idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips
should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a
stake of holly through his heart.  He should!"
</p>

<p>
"Uncle!" pleaded the nephew.
</p>

<p>
"Nephew!" returned the uncle sternly, "keep Christmas
in your own way, and let me keep it in mine."
</p>

<p>
"Keep it!" repeated Scrooge's nephew.  "But you don't
keep it."
</p>

<p>
"Let me leave it alone, then," said Scrooge.  "Much good
may it do you!  Much good it has ever done you!"
</p>

<p>
"There are many things from which I might have derived
good, by which I have not profited, I dare say," returned
the nephew; "Christmas among the rest.  But I am sure I
have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come
round&mdash;apart from the veneration due to its sacred name
and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from
that&mdash;as a good time: a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant
time: the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the
year, when men and women seem by one consent to open
their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them
as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and
not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.  And
therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or
silver in my pocket, I believe that it <i>has</i> done me good, and
<i>will</i> do me good; and I say, God bless it!"
</p>

<p>
The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded: becoming
immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire,
and extinguished the last frail spark forever.
</p>

<p>
"Let me hear another sound from <i>you</i>," said Scrooge,
"and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation.
You're quite a powerful speaker, sir," he added, turning to
his nephew.  "I wonder you don't go into Parliament."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be angry, uncle.  Come!  Dine with us to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Scrooge said that he would see him&mdash;yes, indeed he did.
He went the whole length of the expression, and said that
he would see him in that extremity first.
</p>

<p>
"But why?" cried Scrooge's nephew.  "Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Why did you get married?" said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"Because I fell in love."
</p>

<p>
"Because you fell in love!" growled Scrooge, as if that
were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than
a merry Christmas.  "Good-afternoon!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that
happened.  Why give it as a reason for not coming now?"
</p>

<p>
"Good-afternoon," said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why
can not we be friends?"
</p>

<p>
"Good-afternoon," said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute.
We have never had any quarrel to which I have been a
party.  But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas,
and I'll keep my Christmas humor to the last.  So a Merry
Christmas, uncle!"
</p>

<p>
"Good-afternoon!" said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"And a Happy New Year!"
</p>

<p>
"Good-afternoon!" said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
His nephew left the room without an angry word,
notwithstanding.  He stopped at the outer door to bestow the
greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was,
was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.
</p>

<p>
"There's another fellow," muttered Scrooge, who overheard
him; "my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a
wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas.  I'll retire
to Bedlam."
</p>

<p>
This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two
other people in.  They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to
behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge's
office.  They had books and papers in their hands, and
bowed to him.
</p>

<p>
"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe," said one of the gentlemen,
referring to his list.  "Have I the pleasure of addressing
Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years," Scrooge
replied.  "He died seven years ago, this very night."
</p>

<p>
"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by
his surviving partner," said the gentleman, presenting his
credentials.
</p>

<p>
It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits.
At the ominous word "liberality," Scrooge frowned, and
shook his head, and handed the credentials back.
</p>

<p>
"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge," said
the gentleman, taking up a pen, "it is more than usually
desirable that we should make some slight provision for the
poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.
Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;
hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts,
sir."
</p>

<p>
"Are there no prisons?" asked Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty of prisons," said the gentleman, laying down the
pen again.
</p>

<p>
"And the Union workhouses?" demanded Scrooge.  "Are
they still in operation?"
</p>

<p>
"They are.  Still," returned the gentleman, "I wish I
could say they were not."
</p>

<p>
"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigor,
then?" said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"Both very busy, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something
had occurred to stop them in their useful course," said
Scrooge.  "I'm very glad to hear it."
</p>

<p>
"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian
cheer of mind or body to the multitude," returned the
gentleman, "a few of us are endeavoring to raise a fund to
buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth.
We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when
Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices.  What shall
I put you down for?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing!" Scrooge replied.
</p>

<p>
"You wish to be anonymous?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish to be left alone," said Scrooge.  "Since you ask
me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.  I don't
make merry myself at Christmas, and I can't afford to make
idle people merry.  I help to support the establishments I
have mentioned: they cost enough: and those who are badly
off must go there."
</p>

<p>
"Many can't go there; and many would rather die."
</p>

<p>
"If they would rather die," said Scrooge, "they had better
do it, and decrease the surplus population.  Besides&mdash;excuse
me&mdash;I don't know that."
</p>

<p>
"But you might know it," observed the gentleman.
</p>

<p>
"It's not my business," Scrooge returned.  "It's enough
for a man to understand his own business, and not to
interfere with other people's.  Mine occupies me constantly.
Good afternoon, gentlemen!"
</p>

<p>
Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their
point, the gentlemen withdrew.  Scrooge resumed his labors
with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more
facetious temper than was usual with him.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so that people
ran about with flaring links, proffering their services to
go before horses in carriages and conduct them on their way.
The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was
always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a gothic
window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and
quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterward
as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.
The cold became intense.  In the main street at the corner
of the court, some laborers were repairing the gas-pipes,
and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party
of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their
hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture.
The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly
congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice.  The brightness
of the shops, where holly sprigs and berries crackled in
the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they
passed.  Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid
joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to
impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and
sale had anything to do.  The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold
of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty
cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's
household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had
fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk
and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up to-morrow's
pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and the baby sallied
out to buy the beef.
</p>

<p>
Foggier yet, and colder!  Piercing, searching, biting cold.
If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's
nose with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using
his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to
lusty purpose.  The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed
and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by
dogs, stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with
a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "God bless you, merry gentleman!<br>
  May nothing you dismay!"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the
singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even
more congenial frost.
</p>

<p>
At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house
arrived.  With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool,
and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the
Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his
hat.
</p>

<p>
"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?" said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"If quite convenient, sir."
</p>

<p>
"It's not convenient," said Scrooge, "and it's not fair.
If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself
ill-used, I'll be bound?"
</p>

<p>
The clerk smiled faintly.
</p>

<p>
"And yet," said Scrooge, "you don't think me ill-used,
when I pay a day's wages for no work."
</p>

<p>
The clerk observed that it was only once a year.
</p>

<p>
"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth
of December!" said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat
to the chin.  "But I suppose you must have the whole day.
Be here all the earlier next morning!"
</p>

<p>
The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked
out with a growl.  The office was closed in a twinkling, and
the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling
below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a
slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times,
in honor of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to
Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman's
buff.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy
tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and beguiled
the rest of the evening with his banker's-book, went
home to bed.  He lived in chambers which had once belonged
to his deceased partner.  They were a gloomy suite of rooms,
in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little
business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must
have run there when it was a young house, playing at
hide-and-seek with other houses, and have forgotten the way out
again.  It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for
nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let
out as offices.  The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who
knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.  The
fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the
house that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in
mournful meditation on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular
about the knocker on the door, except that it was very
large.  It is also a fact, that Scrooge had seen it, night and
morning, during his whole residence in that place; also that
Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as
any man in the City of London, even including&mdash;which is a
bold word&mdash;the corporation, aldermen, and livery.  Let it
also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one
thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven-years'
dead partner that afternoon.  And then let any man
explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having
his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without
its undergoing any intermediate process of change: not a
knocker, but Marley's face.
</p>

<p>
Marley's face.  It was not in impenetrable shadow as
the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal light
about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar.  It was not angry
or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look:
with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead.
The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly
motionless.  That, and its livid color, made it horrible; but
its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its
control, rather than a part of its own expression.
</p>

<p>
As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a
knocker again.
</p>

<p>
To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was
not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been
a stranger from infancy, would be untrue.  But he put his
hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily,
walked in, and lighted his candle.
</p>

<p>
He <i>did</i> pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he
shut the door; and he <i>did</i> look cautiously behind it first, as
if he half-expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley's
pigtail sticking out into the hall.  But there was nothing on
the back of the door, except the screws and nuts that held
the knocker on; so he said "Pooh, pooh!" and closed it with
a bang.
</p>

<p>
The sound resounded through the house like thunder.
Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's
cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal of echoes
of its own.  Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by
echoes.  He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,
and up the stairs: slowly, too, trimming his candle as he
went.
</p>

<p>
You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up
a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of
Parliament; but I mean to say you might have got a hearse
up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter-bar
toward the wall, and the door toward the balustrades:
and done it easy.  There was plenty of width for that, and
room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge
thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in
the gloom.  Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street
wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so you may
suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.
</p>

<p>
Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that: darkness
is cheap, and Scrooge liked it.  But before he shut his heavy
door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was
right.  He had just enough recollection of the face to desire
to do that.
</p>

<p>
Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room.  All as they should
be.  Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a
small fire in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the little
saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the
Bob.  Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody
in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious
attitude against the wall.  Lumber-room as usual.  Old
fireguard, old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three
legs, and a poker.
</p>

<p>
Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself
in; double-locked himself in, which was not his custom.
Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on
his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat
down before the fire to take his gruel.
</p>

<p>
It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter
night.  He was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it,
before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from
such a handful of fuel.  The fireplace was an old one, built
by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round
with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
There were Cains and Abels, Pharaohs' daughters, Queens
of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air
on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles
putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of figures, to
attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley, seven years
dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up
the whole.  If each smooth tile had been a blank at first,
with power to shape some picture on its surface from the
disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been
a copy of old Marley's head on every one.
</p>

<p>
"Humbug!" said Scrooge; and walked across the room.
</p>

<p>
After several turns, he sat down again.  As he threw his
head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a
bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated
for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest
story of the building.  It was with great astonishment,
and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he
saw this bell begin to swing.  It swung so softly in the
outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out
loudly, and so did every bell in the house.
</p>

<p>
This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it
seemed an hour.  The bells ceased as they had begun,
together.  They were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep
down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain
over the casks in the wine-merchant's cellar.  Scrooge then
remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses
were described as dragging chains.
</p>

<p>
The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and
then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors below;
then coming up the stairs; then coming straight toward his
door.
</p>

<p>
"It's humbug still!" said Scrooge.  "I won't believe it."
</p>

<p>
His color changed though, when, without a pause, it came
on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before
his eyes.  Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up,
as though it cried "I know him!  Marley's Ghost!" and fell
again.
</p>

<p>
The same face; the very same.  Marley in his pigtail,
usual waistcoat, tights, and boots; the tassels on the latter
bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair
upon his head.  The chain he drew was clasped about his
middle.  It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and
it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes,
keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in
steel.  His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing
him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two
buttons on his coat behind.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no
bowels, but he had never believed it until now.
</p>

<p>
No, nor did he believe it even now.  Though he looked
the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before
him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold
eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief
bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not
observed before: he was still incredulous, and fought against
his senses.
</p>

<p>
"How now!" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.
"What do you want with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Much!"&mdash;Marley's voice, no doubt about it.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Ask me who I <i>was</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Who <i>were</i> you, then?" said Scrooge, raising his voice.
"You're particular&mdash;for a shade."  He was going to say "<i>to</i>
a shade," but substituted this, as more appropriate.
</p>

<p>
"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley."
</p>

<p>
"Can you&mdash;can you sit down?" asked Scrooge, looking
doubtfully at him.
</p>

<p>
"I can."
</p>

<p>
"Do it, then."
</p>

<p>
Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know
whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition
to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being
impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing
explanation.  But the Ghost sat down on the opposite
side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.
</p>

<p>
"You don't believe in me," observed the Ghost.
</p>

<p>
"I don't," said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond
that of your senses?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you doubt your senses?"
</p>

<p>
"Because," said Scrooge, "a little thing affects them.
A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats.  You
may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb
of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato.  There's
more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes,
nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then.
The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of
distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror;
for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his
bones.
</p>

<p>
To sit, staring at those fixed, glazed eyes, in silence for
a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him.
There was something very awful, too, in the spectre's being
provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own.  Scrooge
could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for
though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and
skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapor
from an oven.
</p>

<p>
"You see this toothpick?" said Scrooge, returning quickly
to the charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing,
though it were only for a second, to divert the vision's stony
gaze from himself.
</p>

<p>
"I do," replied the Ghost.
</p>

<p>
"You are not looking at it," said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"But I see it," said the Ghost, "notwithstanding."
</p>

<p>
"Well!" returned Scrooge.  "I have but to swallow this,
and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of
goblins all of my creation.  Humbug, I tell you&mdash;humbug!"
</p>

<p>
At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its
chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge
held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a
swoon.  But how much greater was his horror, when, the
phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it
were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down
upon its breast!
</p>

<p>
Scrooge fell upon his knees and clasped his hands before
his face.
</p>

<p>
"Mercy!" he said.  "Dreadful apparition, why do you
trouble me?"
</p>

<p>
"Man of the worldly mind!" replied the Ghost, "do you
believe in me or not?"
</p>

<p>
"I do," said Scrooge.  "I must.  But why do spirits walk
the earth, and why do they come to me?"
</p>

<p>
"It is required of every man," the Ghost returned, "that
the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellow-men,
and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not
forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death.  It is
doomed to wander through the world&mdash;oh, woe is me!&mdash;and
witness what it can not share, but might have shared
on earth, and turned to happiness!"
</p>

<p>
Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain, and
wrung its shadowy hands.
</p>

<p>
"You are fettered," said Scrooge, trembling.  "Tell me
why?"
</p>

<p>
"I wear the chain I forged in life," replied the Ghost.  "I
made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of
my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it.  Is its
pattern strange to <i>you</i>"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge trembled more and more.
</p>

<p>
"Or would you know," pursued the Ghost, "the weight
and length of the strong coil you bear yourself?  It was full
as heavy, and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago.
You have labored on it, since.  It is a ponderous chain!"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation
of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty
fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Jacob," he said imploringly.  "Old Jacob Marley, tell
me more.  Speak comfort to me, Jacob."
</p>

<p>
"I have none to give," the Ghost replied.  "It comes
from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by
other ministers, to other kinds of men.  Nor can I tell you
what I would.  A very little more, is all permitted to me.
I can not rest, I can not stay, I can not linger anywhere.  My
spirit never walked beyond our counting-house&mdash;mark me!&mdash;in
life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of
our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!"
</p>

<p>
It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful,
to put his hands in his breeches pockets.  Pondering on
what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting
up his eyes, or getting off his knees.
</p>

<p>
"You must have been very slow about it, Jacob," Scrooge
observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility
and deference.
</p>

<p>
"Slow!" the Ghost repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Seven years dead," mused Scrooge.  "And traveling all
the time!"
</p>

<p>
"The whole time," said the Ghost.  "No rest, no peace.
Incessant torture of remorse."
</p>

<p>
"You travel fast?" said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"On the wings of the wind," replied the Ghost.
</p>

<p>
"You might have got over a great quantity of ground
in seven years," said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and
clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the
night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting
it for a nuisance.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed," cried the
phantom, "not to know, that ages of incessant labor, by
immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before
the good of which it is susceptible is all developed.  Not to
know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little
sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short
for its vast means of usefulness.  Not to know that no space
of regret can make amends for one life's opportunity misused!
Yet such was I!  Oh! such was I!"
</p>

<p>
"But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,"
faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.
</p>

<p>
"Business!" cried the Ghost, wringing his hands again.
"Mankind was my business.  The common welfare was my
business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were,
all, my business.  The dealings of my trade were but a drop
of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!"
</p>

<p>
It held up its chain at arm's-length, as if that were the
cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the
ground again.
</p>

<p>
"At this time of the rolling year," the spectre said, "I
suffer most.  Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings
with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that
blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode!
Were there no poor homes to which its light would have
conducted <i>me</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre
going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly.
</p>

<p>
"Hear me!" cried the Ghost.  "My time is nearly gone."
</p>

<p>
"I will," said Scrooge.  "But don't be hard upon me!
Don't be flowery, Jacob!  Pray!"
</p>

<p>
"How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you
can see, I may not tell.  I have sat invisible beside you many
and many a day."
</p>

<p>
It was not an agreeable idea.  Scrooge shivered, and
wiped the perspiration from his brow.
</p>

<p>
"That is no light part of my penance," pursued the
Ghost.  "I am here to-night to warn you that you have yet
a chance and hope of escaping my fate.  A chance and hope
of my procuring, Ebenezer."
</p>

<p>
"You were always a good friend to me," said Scrooge.
"Thank'ee!"
</p>

<p>
"You will be haunted," resumed the Ghost, "by Three
Spirits."
</p>

<p>
Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost's
had done.
</p>

<p>
"Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?" he
demanded, in a faltering voice.
</p>

<p>
"It is."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I think I'd rather not," said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"Without their visits," said the Ghost, "you can not hope
to shun the path I tread.  Expect the first to-morrow, when
the bell tolls one."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?"
hinted Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"Expect the second on the next night at the same hour.
The third upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve
has ceased to vibrate.  Look to see me no more; and look
that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed
between us!"
</p>

<p>
When it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper
from the table, and bound it round its head, as before.
Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made, when
the jaws were brought together by the bandage.  He ventured
to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural
visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain
wound over and about its arm.
</p>

<p>
The apparition walked backward from him; and at every
step it took the window raised itself a little, so that when
the spectre reached it it was wide open.  It beckoned Scrooge
to approach, which he did.  When they were within two paces
of each other, Marley's Ghost held up its hand, warning him
to come no nearer.  Scrooge stopped.
</p>

<p>
Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on
the raising of the hand, he became sensible of confused
noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and
regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory.
The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the
mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark
night.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge followed to the window, desperate in his
curiosity.  He looked out.
</p>

<p>
The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and
thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went.  Every
one of them wore chains like Marley's Ghost; some few
(they might be guilty governments) were linked together;
none were free.  Many had been personally known to
Scrooge in their lives.  He had been quite familiar with one
old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe
attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable
to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw
below, upon a doorstep.  The misery with them all was,
clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human
matters, and had lost the power forever.
</p>

<p>
Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded
them, he could not tell.  But they and their spirit
voices faded together; and the night became as it had been
when he walked home.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by
which the Ghost had entered.  It was double-locked, as he
had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were
undisturbed.  He tried to say "Humbug!" but stopped at the first
syllable.  And being, from the emotion he had undergone,
or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible
World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the
lateness of the hour, much in need of repose, went straight to
bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.
</p>

STAVE TWO

<p class="t3">
<i>The First of the Three Spirits</i>
</p>

<p>
When Scrooge awoke, it was so dark that, looking out
of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window
from the opaque walls of his chamber.  He was endeavoring
to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the
chimes of a neighboring church struck the four quarters.
So he listened for the hour.
</p>

<p>
To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from
six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to
twelve; then stopped.  Twelve!  It was past two when he
went to bed.  The clock was wrong.  An icicle must have
got into the works.  Twelve!
</p>

<p>
He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this
most preposterous clock.  Its rapid little pulse beat twelve;
and stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it isn't possible," said Scrooge, "that I can have
slept through a whole day and far into another night.  It
isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun, and
this is twelve at noon!"
</p>

<p>
The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of
bed, and groped his way to the window.  He was obliged
to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown
before he could see anything; and could see very little then.
All he could make out was that it was still very foggy and
extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running
to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably
would have been if night had beaten off bright day,
and taken possession of the world.  This was a great relief,
because "three days after sight of this First of Exchange
pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order," and so forth,
would have become a mere United States security if there
were no days to count by.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought,
and thought it over and over and over, and could make
nothing of it.  The more he thought, the more perplexed
he was; and the more he endeavored not to think, the more
he thought.  Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly.
Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry,
that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a
strong spring released, to its first position, and presented
the same problem to be worked all through, "Was it a dream
or not?"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge lay in this state until the chimes had gone
three-quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the
Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled
one.  He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed;
and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than
go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his
power.
</p>

<p>
The quarter was so long that he was more than once
convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and
missed the clock.  At length it broke upon his listening ear.
</p>

<p>
"Ding, dong!"
</p>

<p>
"A quarter past," said Scrooge, counting.
</p>

<p>
"Ding, dong!"
</p>

<p>
"Half-past!" said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"Ding, dong!"
</p>

<p>
"A quarter to it," said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"Ding, dong!"
</p>

<p>
"The hour itself," said Scrooge, triumphantly, "and
nothing else!"
</p>

<p>
He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did
with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy One.  Light flashed
up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his
bed were drawn.
</p>

<p>
The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by
a hand.  Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at
his back, but those to which his face was addressed.  The
curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting
up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face
to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close
to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at
your elbow.
</p>

<p>
It was a strange figure&mdash;like a child: yet not so like a
child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural
medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded
from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions.
Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was
white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in
it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin.  The arms were
very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold
were of uncommon strength.  Its legs and feet, most
delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare.  It
wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist was
bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful.  It
held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in
singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress
trimmed with summer flowers.  But the strangest thing
about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprang
a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and
which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller
moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held
under its arm.
</p>

<p>
Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing
steadiness, was not its strangest quality.  For as
its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in
another, and what was light one instant, at another time
was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness:
being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with
twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head
without a body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would
be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away.
And in the very wonder of this, it would be itself again;
distinct and clear as ever.
</p>

<p>
"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to
me?" asked Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"I am!"
</p>

<p>
The voice was soft and gentle.  Singularly low, as if
instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.
</p>

<p>
"Who, and what are you?" Scrooge demanded.
</p>

<p>
"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past."
</p>

<p>
"Long past?" inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish
stature.
</p>

<p>
"No.  Your Past."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if
anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire
to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.
</p>

<p>
"What!" exclaimed the Ghost, "would you so soon put
out, with worldly hands, the light I give?  Is it not enough
that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and
force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon
my brow?"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend, or
any knowledge of having wilfully "bonneted" the Spirit at
any period of his life.  He then made bold to inquire what
business brought him there.
</p>

<p>
"Your welfare!" said the Ghost.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not
help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have
been more conducive to that end.  The Spirit must have
heard him thinking, for it said immediately:
</p>

<p>
"Your reclamation, then.  Take heed!"
</p>

<p>
It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him
gently by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Rise! and walk with me!"
</p>

<p>
It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the
weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian
purposes; that the bed was warm, and the thermometer a long
way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his
slippers, dressing-gown, and night-cap; and that he had a cold
upon him at that time.  The grasp, though gentle as a
woman's hand, was not to be resisted.  He rose: but finding
that the Spirit made toward the window, clasped its robe
in supplication.
</p>

<p>
"I am a mortal," Scrooge remonstrated, "and liable to fall."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bear</i> but a touch of my hand <i>there</i>," said the Spirit,
laying it upon his heart, "and you shall be upheld in more
than this!"
</p>

<p>
As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall,
and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either
hand.  The city had entirely vanished.  Not a vestige of it
was to be seen.  The darkness and the mist had vanished
with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon
the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Good Heaven!" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together,
as he looked about him.  "I was bred in this place.
I was a boy here!"
</p>

<p>
The Spirit gazed upon him mildly.  Its gentle touch,
though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still
present to the old man's sense of feeling.  He was
conscious of a thousand odors floating in the air, each one
connected with a thousand thoughts and hopes, and joys,
and cares long, long forgotten!
</p>

<p>
"Your lip is trembling," said the Ghost.  "And what is
that upon your cheek?"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice,
that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him
where he would.
</p>

<p>
"You recollect the way?" inquired the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
"Remember it!" cried Scrooge with fervor&mdash;"I could walk
it blindfold."
</p>

<p>
"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!"
observed the Ghost.  "Let us go on."
</p>

<p>
They walked along the road: Scrooge recognizing every
gate, and post, and tree; until a little market town appeared
in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.
Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting toward them
with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in
country gigs and carts, driven by farmers.  All these boys
were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the
broad fields were so full of merry music that the crisp air
laughed to hear it.
</p>

<p>
"These are but shadows of the things that have been,"
said the Ghost.  "They have no consciousness of us."
</p>

<p>
The jocund travelers came on; and as they came, Scrooge
knew and named them every one.  Why was he rejoiced beyond
all bounds to see them!  Why did his cold eye glisten,
and his heart leap up as they went past!  Why was he filled
with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry
Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways, for
their several homes!  What was merry Christmas to Scrooge?
Out upon merry Christmas!  What good had it ever done
to him?
</p>

<p>
"The school is not quite deserted," said the Ghost.  "A
solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still."
</p>

<p>
Scrooge said he knew it.  And he sobbed.
</p>

<p>
They left the highroad, by a well-remembered lane, and
soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little
weathercock surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell
hanging in it.  It was a large house, but one of broken
fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls
were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates
decayed.  Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and
the coach-houses and sheds were overrun with grass.  Nor
was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for entering
the dreary hall, and glancing through the open doors of many
rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and vast.
There was an earthy savor in the air, a chilly bareness in the
place, which associated itself somehow with too much
getting up by candle-light, and not too much to eat.
</p>

<p>
They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a
door at the back of the house.  It opened before them, and
disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still
by lines of plain deal forms and desks.  At one of these a
lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat
down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self
as he had used to be.
</p>

<p>
Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle
from the mice behind the paneling, not a drip from the
half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh
among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the
idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a clicking
in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening
influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.
</p>

<p>
The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his
younger self, intent upon his reading.  Suddenly a man, in
foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at:
stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and
leading an ass laden with wood by the bridle.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's Ali Baba!" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy.  "It's
dear old honest Ali Baba!  Yes, yes, I know!  One Christmas
time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone,
he <i>did</i> come, for the first time, just like that.  Poor boy!
And Valentine," said Scrooge, "and his wild brother, Orson;
there they go!  And what's his name, who was put down in
his drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don't you see
him!  And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the
Genii; there he is upon his head!  Serve him right.  I'm
glad of it.  What business had he to be married to the
Princess!"
</p>

<p>
To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his
nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice
between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and
excited face; would have been a surprise to his business
friends in the City, indeed.
</p>

<p>
"There's the Parrot!" cried Scrooge.  "Green body and
yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the
top of his head; there he is!  Poor Robin Crusoe, he called
him, when he came home again after sailing round the island.
'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin Crusoe?'  The
man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't.  It was
the Parrot, you know.  There goes Friday, running for his
life to the little creek!  Halloa!  Hoop!  Halloo!"
</p>

<p>
Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his
usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, "Poor
boy!" and cried again.
</p>

<p>
"I wish," Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his
pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with
his cuff: "but it's too late now."
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" asked the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Scrooge.  "Nothing.  There was a boy
singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night.  I should
like to have given him something: that's all."
</p>

<p>
The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand:
saying as it did so, "Let us see another Christmas!"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the
room became a little darker and more dirty.  The panels
shrank, the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out
of the ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but
how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more than
you do.  He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything
had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when
all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.
</p>

<p>
He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly.
Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful
shaking of his head glanced anxiously toward the door.
</p>

<p>
It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy,
came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and
often kissing him, addressed him as her "Dear, dear brother."
</p>

<p>
"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!" said the
child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh.
"To bring you home, home, home!"
</p>

<p>
"Home, little Fan?" returned the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Yes!" said the child, brimful of glee.  "Home, for good
and all.  Home, forever and ever.  Father is so much kinder
than he used to be that home's like Heaven!  He spoke so
gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that I
was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come
home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach
to bring you.  And you're to be a man!" said the child,
opening her eyes, "and are never to come back here; but first
we're to be together all the Christmas long, and have the
merriest time in all the world."
</p>

<p>
"You are quite a woman, little Fan!" exclaimed the boy.
She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his
head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on
tiptoe to embrace him.  Then she began to drag him, in her
childish eagerness, toward the door; and he, nothing loth to
go, accompanied her.
</p>

<p>
A terrible voice in the hall cried, "Bring down Master
Scrooge's box, there!" and in the hall appeared the
schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a
ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of
mind by shaking hands with him.  He then conveyed him
and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering
best-parlor that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall,
and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were
waxy with cold.  Here he produced a decanter of curiously
light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake, and
administered instalments of those dainties to the young people;
at the same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a
glass of "something" to the postboy, who answered that he
thanked the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had
tasted before, he had rather not.  Master Scrooge's trunk
being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the
children bade the schoolmaster good-by right willingly; and
getting into it, drove gaily down the garden-sweep, the quick
wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark
leaves of the evergreens like spray.
</p>

<p>
"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have
withered," said the Ghost.  "But she had a large heart!"
</p>

<p>
"So she had," cried Scrooge.  "You're right.  I'll not
gainsay it, Spirit.  God forbid!"
</p>

<p>
"She died a woman," said the Ghost, "and had, as I
think, children."
</p>

<p>
"One child," Scrooge returned.
</p>

<p>
"True," said the Ghost.  "Your nephew!"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered
briefly, "Yes."
</p>

<p>
Although they had but that moment left the school
behind them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a
city, where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where
shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the
strife and tumult of a real city were.  It was made plain
enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here too it was
Christmas time again; but it was evening, and the streets
were lighted up.
</p>

<p>
The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and
asked Scrooge if he knew it.
</p>

<p>
"Know it!" said Scrooge.  "I was apprenticed here!"
</p>

<p>
They went in.  At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh
wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been
two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the
ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's old Fezziwig!  Bless his heart; it's Fezziwig
alive again!"
</p>

<p>
Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the
clock, which pointed to the hour of seven.  He rubbed his
hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over
himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and
called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:
</p>

<p>
"Yo ho, there!  Ebenezer!  Dick!"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came
briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.
</p>

<p>
"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!" said Scrooge to the Ghost.
"Bless me, yes.  There he is.  He was very much attached
to me, was Dick.  Poor Dick!  Dear, dear!"
</p>

<p>
"Yo ho, my boys!" said Fezziwig.  "No more work to-night.
Christmas Eve, Dick.  Christmas, Ebenezer!  Let's
have the shutters up," cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap
of his hands, "before a man can say Jack Robinson!"
</p>

<p>
You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it!
They charged into the street with the shutters&mdash;one, two,
three&mdash;had 'em up in their places&mdash;four, five, six&mdash;barred
'em and pinned 'em&mdash;seven, eight, nine&mdash;and came back
before you could have got to twelve, panting like
racehorses.
</p>

<p>
"Hilli-ho!" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the
high desk with wonderful agility.  "Clear away, my lads, and
let's have lots of room here!  Hilli-ho, Dick!  Chirrup,
Ebenezer!"
</p>

<p>
Clear away!  There was nothing they wouldn't have
cleared away, or couldn't have cleared away, with old
Fezziwig looking on.  It was done in a minute.  Every movable
was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life for
evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were
trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse
was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ballroom as
you would desire to see upon a winter's night.
</p>

<p>
In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the
lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty
stomach-aches.  In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial
smile.  In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and
lovable.  In came the six young followers whose hearts they
broke.  In came all the young men and women employed
in the business.  In came the housemaid, with her cousin,
the baker.  In came the cook, with her brother's particular
friend, the milkman.  In came the boy from over the way,
who was suspected of not having board enough from his
master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door
but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by
her mistress.  In they all came, one after another; some
shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some
pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and
everyhow.  Away they all went, twenty couple at once, hands
half round and back again the other way; down the middle
and up again; round and round in various stages of
affectionate grouping; old top couple always turning up in the
wrong place; new top couple starting off again, as soon as
they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one
to help them.  When this result was brought about, old
Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out,
"Well done!" and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a
pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose.  But
scorning rest upon his reappearance, he instantly began
again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other
fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter; and
he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight,
or perish.
</p>

<p>
There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and
more dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and
there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great
piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty
of beer.  But the great effect of the evening came after the
Roast and Boiled when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind!  The
sort of man who knew his business better than you or I
could have told it him!) struck up "Sir Roger de Coverley."  Then
old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig.
Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for
them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who
were not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and
had no notion of walking.
</p>

<p>
But if they had been twice as many: ah, four times: old
Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would
Mrs. Fezziwig.  As to <i>her</i>, she was worthy to be his partner
in every sense of the term.  If that's not high praise, tell me
higher, and I'll use it.  A positive light appeared to issue
from Fezziwig's calves.  They shone in every part of the
dance like moons.  You couldn't have predicted, at any
given time, what would become of 'em next.  And when old
Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the
dance; advance and retire, hold hands with your partner;
bow and courtesy; cork-screw; thread-the-needle, and back
again to your place; Fezziwig "cut"&mdash;cut so deftly, that he
appeared to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again
without a stagger.
</p>

<p>
When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.
Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side
the door, and shaking hands with every person individually
as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas.
When everybody had retired but the two 'prentices, they did
the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away,
and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a
counter in the back-shop.
</p>

<p>
During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a
man out of his wits.  His heart and soul were in the scene,
and with his former self.  He corroborated everything,
remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent
the strangest agitation.  It was not until now, when the
bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from
them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious
that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its
head burned very clear.
</p>

<p>
"A small matter," said the Ghost, "to make these silly
folks so full of gratitude."
</p>

<p>
"Small!" echoed Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices,
who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig:
and when he had done so, said:
</p>

<p>
"Why!  Is it not?  He has spent but a few pounds of
your mortal money: three or four, perhaps.  Is that so much
that he deserves this praise?"
</p>

<p>
"It isn't that," said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and
speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.
"It isn't that, Spirit.  He has the power to render us happy
or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a
pleasure or a toil.  Say that his power lies in words and
looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is
impossible to add and count 'em up: what then?  The happiness
he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune."
</p>

<p>
He felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" asked the Ghost.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing particular," said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"Something, I think?" the Ghost insisted.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Scrooge, "no.  I should like to be able to say
a word or two to my clerk just now!  That's all."
</p>

<p>
His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance
to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side
by side in the open air.
</p>

<p>
"My time grows short," observed the Spirit.  "Quick!"
</p>

<p>
This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom
he could see, but it produced an immediate effect.  For again
Scrooge saw himself.  He was older now; a man in the prime
of life.  His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later
years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice.
There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which
showed the passion that had taken root, and where the
shadow of the growing tree would fall.
</p>

<p>
He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl
in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which
sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas
Past.
</p>

<p>
"It matters little," she said, softly.  "To you, very little.
Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and
comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do,
I have no just cause to grieve."
</p>

<p>
"What Idol has displaced you?" he rejoined.
</p>

<p>
"A golden one."
</p>

<p>
"This is the even-handed dealing of the world!" he said.
"There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and
there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity
as the pursuit of wealth!"
</p>

<p>
"You fear the world too much," she answered, gently.
"All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being
beyond the chance of its sordid reproach.  I have seen your
nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the
master-passion, Gain, engrosses you.  Have I not?"
</p>

<p>
"What then?" he retorted.  "Even if I have grown so
much wiser, what then?  I am not changed toward you."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Am I?"
</p>

<p>
"Our contract is an old one.  It was made when we were
both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we
could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry.
You <i>are</i> changed.  When it was made, you were another
man."
</p>

<p>
"I was a boy," he said impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you
are," she returned.  "I am.  That which promised happiness
when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that
we are two.  How often and how keenly I have thought
of this, I will not say.  It is enough that I <i>have</i> thought of
it, and can release you."
</p>

<p>
"Have I ever sought release?"
</p>

<p>
"In words?  No.  Never."
</p>

<p>
"In what, then?"
</p>

<p>
"In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another
atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end.  In
everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight.
If this had never been between us," said the girl, looking
mildly, but with steadiness, upon him, "tell me, would you
seek me out and try to win me now?  Ah, no!"
</p>

<p>
He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in
spite of himself.  But he said with a struggle, "You think
not."
</p>

<p>
"I would gladly think otherwise if I could," she answered,
"Heaven knows!  When <i>I</i> have learned a Truth like this, I
know how strong and irresistible it must be.  But if you
were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe
that you would choose a dowerless girl&mdash;you who, in your
very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or,
choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to
your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your
repentance and regret would surely follow?  I do; and I
release you.  With a full heart, for the love of him you
once were."
</p>

<p>
He was about to speak; but with her head turned from
him, she resumed.
</p>

<p>
"You may&mdash;the memory of what is past half makes me
hope you will&mdash;have pain in this.  A very, very brief time,
and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an
unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you
awoke.  May you be happy in the life you have chosen!"
</p>

<p>
She left him, and they parted.
</p>

<p>
"Spirit!" said Scrooge, "show me no more!  Conduct me
home.  Why do you delight to torture me?"
</p>

<p>
"One shadow more!" exclaimed the Ghost.
</p>

<p>
"No more!" cried Scrooge.  "No more.  I don't wish to
see it.  Show me no more!"
</p>

<p>
But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms,
and forced him to observe what happened next.
</p>

<p>
They were in another scene and place; a room not very
large or handsome, but full of comfort.  Near to the winter
fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like the last that Scrooge
believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely
matron, sitting opposite her daughter.  The noise in this
room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children
there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could
count; and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were
not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every
child was conducting itself like forty.  The consequences
were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;
on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,
and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning
to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands
most ruthlessly.  What would I not have given to be one
of them!  Though I never could have been so rude, no, no!
I wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that
braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little
shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to
save my life.  As to measuring her waist in sport, as they
did, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should
have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment,
and never come straight again.  And yet I should
have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have
questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have
looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never
raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of
which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should
have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest license of
a child, and yet been man enough to know its value.
</p>

<p>
But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a
rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and
plundered dress was borne toward it the centre of a flushed
and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who
came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys
and presents.  Then the shouting and the struggling, and the
onslaught that was made on the defenseless porter!  The
scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets,
despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his
cravat, hug him round the neck, pommel his back, and kick
his legs in irrepressible affection!  The shouts of wonder
and delight with which the development of every package
was received!  The terrible announcement that the baby had
been taken in the act of putting a doll's frying-pan into his
mouth, and was more than suspected of having swallowed
a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter!  The immense
relief of finding this a false alarm!  The joy, and gratitude,
and ecstasy!  They are all indescribable alike.  It is enough
that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of
the parlor and by one stair at a time, up to the top of the
house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.
</p>

<p>
And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever,
when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning
fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his
own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature,
quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have
called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard
winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.
</p>

<p>
"Belle," said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile,
"I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"Who was it?"
</p>

<p>
"Guess!"
</p>

<p>
"How can I?  Tut, don't I know?" she added in the same
breath, laughing as he laughed.  "Mr. Scrooge."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Scrooge it was.  I passed his office window; and
as it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could
scarcely help seeing him.  His partner lies upon the point
of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.  Quite alone in
the world, I do believe."
</p>

<p>
"Spirit!" said Scrooge in a broken voice, "remove me
from this place."
</p>

<p>
"I told you these were shadows of the things that have
been," said the Ghost.  "That they are what they are, do not
blame me!"
</p>

<p>
"Remove me!" Scrooge exclaimed, "I can not bear it!"
</p>

<p>
He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon
him with a face, in which in some strange way there were
fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.
</p>

<p>
"Leave me!  Take me back.  Haunt me no longer!"
</p>

<p>
In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which
the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was
undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed
that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly
connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the
extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon
its head.
</p>

<p>
The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher
covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down
with all his force, he could not hide the light, which streamed
from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by
an irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own
bedroom.  He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his
hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he
sank into a heavy sleep.
</p>

<p class="t3">
STAVE THREE
</p>

<p class="t3">
<i>The Second of the Three Spirits</i>
</p>

<p>
Awakening in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore
and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge
had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the
stroke of One.  He felt that he was restored to consciousness
in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of
holding a conference with the second messenger despatched
to him through Jacob Marley's intervention.  But, finding
that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder
which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back,
he put them every one aside with his own hands, and lying
down again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed.
For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its
appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and
made nervous.
</p>

<p>
Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves
on being acquainted with a move or two, and being
usually equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of
their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good
for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between
which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably
wide and comprehensive range of subjects.  Without
venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don't mind
calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad
field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a
baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very
much.
</p>

<p>
Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by
any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when
the Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken
with a violent fit of trembling.  Five minutes, ten minutes,
a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.  All this
time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a
blaze of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock
proclaimed the hour; and which, being only light, was more
alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make
out what it meant, or would be at; and was sometimes
apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an
interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the
consolation of knowing it.  At last, however, he began to
think&mdash;as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always
the person not in the predicament who knows what ought
to have been done in it, and would unquestionably have
done it too&mdash;at last, I say, he began to think that the source
and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining
room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine.
This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly
and shuffled in his slippers to the door.
</p>

<p>
The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange
voice called him by his name, and bade him enter.  He
obeyed.
</p>

<p>
It was his own room.  There was no doubt about that.  But
it had undergone a surprising transformation.  The walls
and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a
perfect grove, from every part of which bright gleaming
berries glistened.  The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and
ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had
been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring
up the chimney as that dull petrifaction of a hearth had
never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and
many a winter season gone.  Heaped up on the floor, to form
a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn,
great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,
mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot
chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears,
immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that
made the chamber dim with their delicious steam.  In easy
state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see;
who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty's horn,
and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge, as he
came peeping round the door.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!" exclaimed the Ghost.  "Come in! and know
me better, man!"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this
Spirit.  He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and
though the Spirit's eyes were clear and kind, he did not like
to meet them.
</p>

<p>
"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present," said the Spirit.
"Look upon me!"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge reverently did so.  It was clothed in one simple
deep-green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur.  This
garment hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious
breast was bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed
by any artifice.  Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds
of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no
other covering than a holly wreath set here and there with
shining icicles.  Its dark-brown curls were long and free;
free as its genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its
cheery voice, its unconstrained demeanor, and its joyful air.
Girdled round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no
sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with
rust.
</p>

<p>
"You have never seen the like of me before!" exclaimed
the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
"Never," Scrooge made answer to it.
</p>

<p>
"Have never walked forth with the younger members
of my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder
brothers born in these later years?" pursued the Phantom.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I have," said Scrooge.  "I am afraid I have
not.  Have you had many brothers, Spirit?"
</p>

<p>
"More than eighteen hundred," said the Ghost.
</p>

<p>
"A tremendous family to provide for!" muttered Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.
</p>

<p>
"Spirit," said Scrooge submissively, "conduct me where
you will.  I went forth last night on compulsion, and I
learned a lesson which is working now.  To-night, if you
have aught to teach me, let me profit by it."
</p>

<p>
"Touch my robe!"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.
</p>

<p>
Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game,
poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings,
fruit, and punch, all vanished instantly.  So did the room,
the fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood
in the City streets on Christmas morning, where (for the
weather was severe) the people made a rough but brisk and
not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the
pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of
their houses: whence it was mad delight to the boys to see
it come plumping down into the road below, and splitting
into artificial little snowstorms.
</p>

<p>
The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows
blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow
upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground;
which last deposit had been plowed up in deep furrows by
the heavy wheels of carts and wagons; furrows that crossed
and recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great
streets branched off, and made intricate channels, hard to
trace, in the thick yellow mud and icy water.  The sky was
gloomy, and the shortest streets were choked up with a
dingy mist, half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles
descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys
in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were
blazing away to their dear hearts' content.  There was
nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet
was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest
summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavored
to diffuse in vain.
</p>

<p>
For the people who were shoveling away on the housetops
were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another
from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious
snowball&mdash;better-natured missile far than many a wordy
jest&mdash;laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if
it went wrong.  The poulterers' shops were still half open,
and the fruiterers were radiant in their glory.  There were
great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like
the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors,
and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic
opulence.  There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish
Onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish
Friars; and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at
the girls as they went by and glanced demurely at the
hung-up mistletoe.  There were pears and apples, clustered high
in blooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made,
in the shopkeepers' benevolence, to dangle from conspicuous
hooks, that people's mouths might water gratis as they
passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and brown,
recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and
pleasant shufflings ankle-deep through withered leaves; there
were Norfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy, setting off the
yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness
of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching
to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner.
The very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice
fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded
race, appeared to know that there was something
going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their
little world in slow and passionless excitement.
</p>

<p>
The Grocers'! oh the Grocers'! nearly closed, with
perhaps two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps
such glimpses!  It was not alone that the scales descending
on the counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and
roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were
rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the
blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose,
or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the
almonds so extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long
and straight, the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits
so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the
coldest lookers-on feel faint and subsequently bilious.  Nor
was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French
plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly decorated
boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its
Christmas dress: but the customers were all so hurried and
so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled
up against each other at the door, clashing their wicker
baskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter,
and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds
of the like mistakes in the best humor possible; while
the Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the
polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons
behind might have been their own, worn outside for general
inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.
</p>

<p>
But soon the steeples called good people all to church and
chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets
in their best clothes, and with their gayest faces.  And at
the same time there emerged from scores of by-streets,
lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying
their dinners to the bakers' shops.  The sight of these poor
revelers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he
stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and
taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled
incense on their dinners from his torch.  And it was a very
uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice when there were
angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled
with each other, he shed a few drops of water on them
from it, and their good humor was restored directly.  For
they said it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day.
And so it was!  God love it, so it was!
</p>

<p>
In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up;
and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these
dinners and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch
of wet above each baker's oven; where the pavement smoked
as if its stones were cooking too.
</p>

<p>
"Is there a peculiar flavor in what you sprinkle from your
torch?" asked Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"There is.  My own."
</p>

<p>
"Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?"
asked Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"To any kindly given.  To a poor one most."
</p>

<p>
"Why to a poor one most?" asked Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"Because it needs it most."
</p>

<p>
"Spirit," said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, "I
wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us,
should desire to cramp these people's opportunities of
innocent enjoyment."
</p>

<p>
"I!" cried the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
"You would deprive them of their means of dinner every
seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said
to dine at all," said Scrooge.  "Wouldn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I!" cried the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
"You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day!"
said Scrooge.  "And it comes to the same thing."
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> seek!" exclaimed the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me if I am wrong.  It has been done in your
name, or at least in that of your family," said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"There are some upon this earth of yours," returned the
Spirit, "who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds
of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and
selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith
and kin, as if they had never lived.  Remember that, and
charge their doings on themselves, not us."
</p>

<p>
Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on,
invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the
town.  It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which
Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that notwithstanding
his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place
with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as
gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible
he could have done in any lofty hall.
</p>

<p>
And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in
showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind,
generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor
men, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there he
went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and
on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped
to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinklings of his
torch.  Think of that!  Bob had but fifteen "Bob" a week
himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his
Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present
blessed his four-roomed house!
</p>

<p>
Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out
but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons,
which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and
she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of
her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter
Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and
getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob's
private property, conferred upon his son and heir in honor of
the day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly
attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable
Parks.  And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl,
came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they had
smelled the goose, and known it for their own; and basking
in luxurious thoughts of sage-and-onion, these young
Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter
Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his
collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow
potatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be
let out and peeled.
</p>

<p>
"What has ever got your precious father, then?" said
Mrs. Cratchit.  "And your brother, Tiny Tim!  And Martha
warn't as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour!"
</p>

<p>
"Here's Martha, mother!" said a girl, appearing as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Here's Martha, mother!" cried the two young Cratchits.
"Hurrah!  There's <i>such</i> a goose, Martha!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!"
said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off
her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.
</p>

<p>
"We'd a deal of work to finish up last night," replied the
girl, "and had to clear away this morning, mother!"
</p>

<p>
"Well!  Never mind so long as you are come," said
Mrs. Cratchit.  "Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a
warm, Lord bless ye!"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!  There's father coming," cried the two young
Cratchits, who were everywhere at once.  "Hide, Martha,
hide!"
</p>

<p>
So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father,
with at least three feet of comforter, exclusive of the fringe,
hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned
up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his
shoulder.  Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and
had his limbs supported by an iron frame!
</p>

<p>
"Why, where's our Martha?" cried Bob Cratchit, looking
round.
</p>

<p>
"Not coming," said Mrs. Cratchit.
</p>

<p>
"Not coming!" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his
high spirits; for he had been Tim's blood horse all the way
from church, and had come home rampant.  "Not coming
upon Christmas Day!"
</p>

<p>
Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only
in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet
door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits
hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house,
that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.
</p>

<p>
"And how did little Tim behave?" asked Mrs. Cratchit,
when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had
hugged his daughter to his heart's content.
</p>

<p>
"As good as gold," said Bob, "and better.  Somehow he
gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the
strangest things you ever heard.  He told me, coming home,
that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he
was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember
upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk and
blind men see."
</p>

<p>
Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and
trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing
strong and hearty.
</p>

<p>
His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and
back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted
by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire;
and while Bob, turning up his cuffs&mdash;as if, poor fellow, they
were capable of being made more shabby&mdash;compounded some
hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it
round and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master
Peter, and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch
the goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.
</p>

<p>
Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a
goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to
which a black swan was a matter of course&mdash;and in truth
it was something very like it in that house.  Mrs. Cratchit
made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan)
hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible
vigor; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha
dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a
tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs
for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting
guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths,
lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to
be helped.  At last the dishes were set on, and grace
was said.  It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as
Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared
to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the
long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of
delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim,
excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the
handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!
</p>

<p>
There never was such a goose.  Bob said he didn't believe
there ever was such a goose cooked.  Its tenderness
and flavor, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal
admiration.  Eked out by the apple sauce and mashed potatoes,
it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed,
as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small
atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last!
Yet every one had had enough, and the younger Cratchits in
particular, were steeped in sage-and-onion to the eyebrows!
But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda,
Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone&mdash;too nervous to bear
witness&mdash;to take the pudding up and bring it in.
</p>

<p>
Suppose it should not be done enough!  Suppose it should
break in turning out!  Suppose somebody should have got
over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they were
merry with the goose&mdash;a supposition at which the two
young Cratchits became livid!  All sorts of horrors were
supposed.
</p>

<p>
Hallo!  A great deal of steam!  The pudding was out
of the copper.  A smell like a washing-day!  That was the
cloth.  A smell like an eating-house and a pastry-cook's next
door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that!
That was the pudding!  In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit
entered&mdash;flushed, but smiling proudly&mdash;with the pudding, like
a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of
half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas
holly stuck into the top.
</p>

<p>
Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly
too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by
Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage.  Mrs. Cratchit said that
now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she
had had her doubts about the quantity of flour.  Everybody
had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it
was at all a small pudding for a large family.  It would have
been flat heresy to do so.  Any Cratchit would have blushed
to hint at such a thing.
</p>

<p>
At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared,
the hearth swept, and the fire made up.  The compound in
the jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and
oranges were put upon the table, and a shovelful of chestnuts
on the fire.  Then all the Cratchit family drew round
the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning
half a one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbows stood the family
display of glass.  Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a
handle.
</p>

<p>
These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well
as golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out
with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered
and cracked noisily.  Then Bob proposed:
</p>

<p>
"A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears.  God bless us!"
</p>

<p>
Which all the family reechoed.
</p>

<p>
"God bless us, every one!" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.
</p>

<p>
He sat very close to his father's side upon his little stool.
Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the
child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that
he might be taken from him.
</p>

<p>
"Spirit," said Scrooge, with an interest he had never
felt before, "tell me if Tiny Tim will live."
</p>

<p>
"I see a vacant seat," replied the Ghost, "in the poor
chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully
preserved.  If these shadows remain unaltered by the future,
the child will die."
</p>

<p>
"No, no," said Scrooge.  "Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he will
be spared."
</p>

<p>
"If these shadows remain unaltered by the future, none
other of my race," returned the Ghost, "will find him here.
What then?  If he be like to die, he had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population."
</p>

<p>
Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by
the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.
</p>

<p>
"Man," said the Ghost, "if man you be in heart, not
adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered
What the surplus is, and Where it is.  Will you decide what
men shall live, what men shall die?  It may be that in the
sight of Heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live
than millions like this poor man's child.  Oh God! to hear
the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life
among his hungry brothers in the dust!"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and trembling
cast his eyes upon the ground.  But he raised them speedily,
on hearing his own name.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Scrooge!" said Bob; "I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the
Founder of the Feast!"
</p>

<p>
"The Founder of the Feast indeed!" cried Mrs. Cratchit,
reddening.  "I wish I had him here.  I'd give him a piece of
my mind to feast upon, and I hope he'd have a good
appetite for it."
</p>

<p>
"My dear," said Bob, "the children!  Christmas Day."
</p>

<p>
"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure," said she, "on
which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard,
unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge.  You know he is, Robert!
Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear," was Bob's mild answer, "Christmas Day."
</p>

<p>
"I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's," said
Mrs. Cratchit, "not for his.  Long life to him!  A Merry
Christmas and a Happy New Year!  He'll be very merry
and very happy, I have no doubt!"
</p>

<p>
The children drank the toast after her.  It was the first
of their proceedings which had no heartiness in it.  Tiny
Tim drank it last of all, but he didn't care twopence for it.
Scrooge was the Ogre of the family.  The mention of his
name cast a dark shadow on the party, which was not
dispelled for fully five minutes.
</p>

<p>
After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier
than before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful
being done with.  Bob Cratchit told them how he had a
situation in his eye for Master Peter, which would bring in,
if obtained, fully five-and-sixpence weekly.  The two young
Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being
a man of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at
the fire from between his collars, as if he were deliberating
what particular investments he should favor when he came
into the receipt of that bewildering income.  Martha, who
was a poor apprentice at a milliner's, then told them what
kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she
worked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed
to-morrow morning for a good long rest; to-morrow being a
holiday she passed at home.  Also how she had seen a countess
and a lord some days before, and how the lord "was much
about as tall as Peter"; at which Peter pulled up his collars
so high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had
been there.  All this time the chestnuts and the jug went
round and round; and by and by they had a song, about a
lost child traveling in the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a
plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing of high mark in this.  They were not
a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes
were far from being waterproof; their clothes were scanty;
and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside
of a pawnbroker's.  But, they were happy, grateful, pleased
with one another, and contented with the time; and when
they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings
of the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon
them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.
</p>

<p>
By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty
heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the
streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens,
parlors, and all sorts of rooms, was wonderful.  Here the
flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cozy dinner,
with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,
and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold
and darkness.  There all the children of the house were
running out into the snow to meet their married sisters,
brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet
them.  Here, again, were shadows on the window-blind of
guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls,
all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped
lightly off to some near neighbor's house; where, woe upon
the single man who saw them enter&mdash;artful witches: well
they knew it&mdash;in a glow!
</p>

<p>
But if you had judged from the numbers of people on
their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought
that no one was at home to give them welcome when they
got there, instead of every house expecting company, and
piling up its fires half-chimney high.  Blessings on it, how
the Ghost exulted!  How it bared its breadth of breast, and
opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with
a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything
within its reach!  The very lamplighter, who ran on before
dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was
dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly
as the Spirit passed: though little kenned the lamplighter
that he had any company but Christmas!
</p>

<p>
And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost,
they stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous
masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the
burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever
it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost that held
it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,
rank grass.  Down in the west the setting sun had left a
streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an
instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower
yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.
</p>

<p>
"What place is this?" asked Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"A place where Miners live, who labor in the bowels of
the earth," returned the Spirit.  "But they know me.  See!"
</p>

<p>
A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly
they advanced toward it.  Passing through the wall of mud
and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round
a glowing fire.  An old, old man and woman, with their
children and their children's children, and another generation
beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.  The
old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of
the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas
song; it had been a very old song when he was a boy;
and from time to time they all joined in the chorus.  So
surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite
blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigor
sank again.
</p>

<p>
The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold
his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped whither?
Not to sea?  To sea.  To Scrooge's horror, looking back,
he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind
them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of
water, as it rolled, and roared, and raged among the dreadful
caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the
earth.
</p>

<p>
Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or
so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the
wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse.  Great
heaps of seaweed clung to its base, and storm-birds&mdash;born
of the wind one might suppose, as seaweed of the water&mdash;rose
and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.
</p>

<p>
But even here, two men who watched the light had made
a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed
out a ray of brightness on the awful sea.  Joining their
horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they
wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog;
and one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged
and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old
ship might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale
in itself.
</p>

<p>
Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving
sea&mdash;on, on&mdash;until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from
any shore, they lighted on a ship.  They stood beside the
helmsman at the wheel, the lookout in the bow, the officers
who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several
stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune,
or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to
his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward
hopes belonging to it.  And every man on board, waking
or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another
on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to
some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he
cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to
remember him.
</p>

<p>
It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the
moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it
was to move on through the lonely darkness over an
unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as
Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus
engaged, to hear a hearty laugh.  It was a much greater
surprise to Scrooge to recognize it as his own nephew's and to
find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit
standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same
nephew with approving affability.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha!" laughed Scrooge's nephew.  "Ha, ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know
a man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I
can say is, I should like to know him too.  Introduce him to
me, and I'll cultivate his acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that
while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is
nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter
and good-humor.  When Scrooge's nephew laughed in this
way: holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face
into the most extravagant contortions: Scrooge's niece, by
marriage, laughed as heartily as he.  And their assembled
friends being not a bit behindhand, roared out, lustily.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
"He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!" cried
Scrooge's nephew.  "He believed it too!"
</p>

<p>
"More shame for him, Fred!" said Scrooge's niece,
indignantly.  Bless those women; they never do anything by
halves.  They are always in earnest.
</p>

<p>
She was very pretty; exceedingly pretty.  With a dimpled,
surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that
seemed made to be kissed&mdash;as no doubt it was; all kinds of
good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another
when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever
saw in any little creature's head.  Altogether she was what
you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory,
too.  Oh, perfectly satisfactory!
</p>

<p>
"He's a comical old fellow," said Scrooge's nephew, "that's
the truth; and not so pleasant as he might be.  However, his
offenses carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to
say against him."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure he is very rich, Fred," hinted Scrooge's niece.
"At least you always tell <i>me</i> so."
</p>

<p>
"What of that, my dear!" said Scrooge's nephew.  "His
wealth is of no use to him.  He don't do any good with it.
He don't make himself comfortable with it.  He hasn't the
satisfaction of thinking&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;that he is ever going to
benefit Us with it."
</p>

<p>
"I have no patience with him," observed Scrooge's niece.
Scrooge's niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed
the same opinion.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I have!" said Scrooge's nephew.  "I am sorry for
him; I couldn't be angry with him if I tried.  Who suffers
by his ill whims?  Himself, always.  Here, he takes it into
his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine with us.
What's the consequence?  He don't lose much of a dinner."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner," interrupted
Scrooge's niece.  Everybody else said the same, and they
must be allowed to have been competent judges, because they
had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the table,
were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.
</p>

<p>
"Well!  I'm very glad to hear it," said Scrooge's nephew,
"because I haven't any great faith in these young
housekeepers.  What do you say, Topper?"
</p>

<p>
Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's
niece's sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a
wretched outcast, who had no right to express an opinion
on the subject.  Whereat Scrooge's niece's sister&mdash;the plump
one with the lace tucker: not the one with the
roses&mdash;blushed.
</p>

<p>
"Do go on, Fred," said Scrooge's niece, clapping her
hands.  "He never finishes what he begins to say.  He is
such a ridiculous fellow!"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge's nephew reveled in another laugh, and as it was
impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister
tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was
unanimously followed.
</p>

<p>
"I was only going to say," said Scrooge's nephew, "that
the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making
merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant
moments, which could do him no harm.  I am sure he loses
pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts,
either in his moldy old office, or his dusty chambers.  I mean
to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it
or not, for I pity him.  He may rail at Christmas till he dies,
but he can't help thinking better of it&mdash;I defy him&mdash;if he finds
me going there, in good temper, year after year, and saying,
'Uncle Scrooge, how are you?'  If it only puts him in the
vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, <i>that's</i> something;
and I think I shook him yesterday."
</p>

<p>
It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his
shaking Scrooge.  But being thoroughly good-natured, and not
much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at
any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed
the bottle joyously.
</p>

<p>
After tea, they had some music.  For they were a musical
family, and knew what they were about, when they sang a
Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who
could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never
swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face
over it.  Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and
played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere
nothing: you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which
had been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the
boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of
Christmas Past.  When this strain of music sounded, all the
things that Ghost had shown him came upon his mind; he
softened more and more; and thought that if he could have
listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the
kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands,
without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob
Marley.
</p>

<p>
But they didn't devote the whole evening to music.  After
a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children
sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its
mighty Founder was a child himself.  Stop!  There was first
a game at blind-man's buff.  Of course there was.  And I
no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he
had eyes in his boots.  My opinion is, that it was a done
thing between him and Scrooge's nephew: and that the
Ghost of Christmas Present knew it.  The way he went after
that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the
credulity of human nature.  Knocking down the fire-irons,
tumbling over the chairs, bumping up against the piano,
smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,
there went he.  He always knew where the plump sister was.
He wouldn't catch anybody else.  If you had fallen up
against him, as some of them did, and stood there; he would
have made a feint of endeavoring to seize you, which would
have been an affront to your understanding; and would
instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.
She often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not.
But when at last he caught her; when, in spite of all her
silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got
her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his
conduct was the most execrable.  For his pretending not to
know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her
head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by
pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain
about her neck; was vile, monstrous!  No doubt she told
him her opinion of it, when, another blind man being in
office, they were so very confidential together, behind the
curtains.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind-man's buff party,
but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool,
in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close
behind her.  But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her
love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.
Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very
great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat her
sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper
could have told you.  There might have been twenty people
there, young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge;
for, wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was
going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he
sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very
often guessed quite right, too; for the sharpest needle, best
Whitechapel, warranted not to cut in the eye, was not
sharper than Scrooge: blunt as he took it in his head to be.
</p>

<p>
The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood,
and looked upon him with such favor that he begged like a
boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed.  But this
the Spirit said could not be done.
</p>

<p>
"Here is a new game," said Scrooge.  "One half-hour,
Spirit, only one!"
</p>

<p>
It is a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew
had to think of something, and the rest must find out what;
he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case
was.  The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed
elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live
animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an
animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked
sometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the
streets, and wasn't made a show of, and wasn't led by anybody,
and didn't live in a menagerie, and was never killed in
a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull,
or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear.  At every
fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into
a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled
that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp.  At last
the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:
</p>

<p>
"I have found it out!  I know what it is, Fred!  I know
what it is!"
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" cried Fred.
</p>

<p>
"It's your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!"
</p>

<p>
Which it certainly was.  Admiration was the universal
sentiment, though some objected that the reply to "Is it a
bear?" ought to have been "Yes"; inasmuch as an answer in
the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts
from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency
that way.
</p>

<p>
"He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure," said
Fred, "and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health.
Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the
moment; and I say, 'Uncle Scrooge!'"
</p>

<p>
"Well!  Uncle Scrooge!" they cried.
</p>

<p>
"A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old
man, whatever he is!" said Scrooge's nephew.  "He wouldn't
take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless.  Uncle
Scrooge!"
</p>

<p>
Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light
of heart that he would have pledged the unconscious company
in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech, if
the Ghost had given him time.  But the whole scene passed
off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew; and
he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.
</p>

<p>
Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they
visited, but always with a happy end.  The Spirit stood
beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands,
and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they
were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was
rich.  In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery's every
refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made
fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing,
and taught Scrooge his precepts.
</p>

<p>
It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge
had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays
appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed
together.  It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained
unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly
older.  Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke
of it until they left a children's Twelfth Night party, when,
looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place,
he noticed that its hair was gray.
</p>

<p>
"Are spirits' lives so short?" asked Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"My life upon this globe is very brief," replied the Ghost.
"It ends to-night."
</p>

<p>
"To-night!" cried Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"To-night at midnight.  Hark!  The time is drawing near."
</p>

<p>
The chimes were ringing the three-quarters past eleven
at that moment.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask," said
Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit's robe, "but I see
something strange, and not belonging to yourself,
protruding from your skirts.  Is it a foot or a claw!"
</p>

<p>
"It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it," was
the Spirit's sorrowful reply.  "Look here."
</p>

<p>
From the foldings of its robe it brought two children;
wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable.  They knelt
down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Man! look here.  Look, look, down here!" exclaimed
the Ghost.
</p>

<p>
They were a boy and girl.  Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling,
wolfish; but, prostrate, too, in their humility.  Where
graceful youth should have filled their features out, and
touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shriveled
hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and
pulled them into shreds.  Where angels might have sat
enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing.  No change,
no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade,
through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has
monsters half so horrible and dread.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge started back, appalled.  Having them shown to
him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but
the words choked themselves rather than be parties to a lie
of such enormous magnitude.
</p>

<p>
"Spirit! are they yours?" Scrooge could say no more.
</p>

<p>
"They are Man's," said the Spirit, looking down upon
them.  "And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers.
This boy is Ignorance.  This girl is Want.  Beware them
both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this
boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless
the writing be erased.  Deny it!" cried the Spirit, stretching
out its hand toward the City.  "Slander those who tell it ye!
Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse!
And bide the end!"
</p>

<p>
"Have they no refuge or resource?" cried Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"Are there no prisons?" said the Spirit, turning on him
for the last time with his own words.  "Are there no
workhouses?"
</p>

<p>
The bell struck twelve.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not.
As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the
prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld
a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist
along the ground, toward him.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
STAVE FOUR
</p>

<p class="t3">
<i>The Last of the Spirits</i>
</p>

<p>
The phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached.
When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee;
for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed
to scatter gloom and mystery.
</p>

<p>
It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed
its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible
save one outstretched hand.  But for this it would have
been difficult to detach its figure from the night, and
separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded.
</p>

<p>
He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside
him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a
solemn dread.  He knew no more, for the Spirit neither spoke
nor moved.
</p>

<p>
"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To
Come?" said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
The Spirit answered not, but pointed downward with its
hand.
</p>

<p>
"You are about to show me shadows of the things that
have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,"
Scrooge pursued.  "Is that so, Spirit?"
</p>

<p>
The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an
instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head.
That was the only answer he received.
</p>

<p>
Although well used to ghostly company by this time,
Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs
trembled beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand
when he prepared to follow it.  The Spirit paused a moment,
as if observing his condition, and giving him time
to recover.
</p>

<p>
But Scrooge was all the worse for this.  It thrilled him
with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the
dusky shroud there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon
him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost,
could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap
of black.
</p>

<p>
"Ghost of the Future!" he exclaimed, "I fear you more
than any Spectre I have seen.  But, as I know your purpose
is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another
man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company,
and do it with a thankful heart.  Will you not speak to
me?"
</p>

<p>
It gave him no reply.  The hand was pointed straight
before them.
</p>

<p>
"Lead on!" said Scrooge.  "Lead on!  The night is
waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know.  Lead
on, Spirit!"
</p>

<p>
The Phantom moved away as it had come toward him.
Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore
him up, he thought, and carried him along.
</p>

<p>
They scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City
rather seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them
of its own act.  But there they were, in the heart of it;
on 'Change, among the merchants; who hurried up and
down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and
conversed in groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled
thoughtfully with their great gold seals; and so forth, as
Scrooge had seen them often.
</p>

<p>
The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men.
Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge
advanced to listen to their talk.
</p>

<p>
"No," said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, "I
don't know much about it, either way.  I only know he's
dead."
</p>

<p>
"When did he die?" inquired another.
</p>

<p>
"Last night, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"Why, what was the matter with him?" asked a third,
taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large
snuffbox.  "I thought he'd never die."
</p>

<p>
"God knows," said the first, with a yawn.
</p>

<p>
"What has he done with his money?" asked a red-faced
gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his
nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't heard," said the man with the large chin,
yawning again.  "Left it to his Company, perhaps.  He
hasn't left it to me.  That's all I know."
</p>

<p>
This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.
</p>

<p>
"It's likely to be a very cheap funeral," said the same
speaker; "for upon my life I don't know of anybody to go
to it.  Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind going if a lunch is provided," observed
the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose.  "But I
must be fed, if I make one."
</p>

<p>
Another laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after
all," said the first speaker, "for I never wear black gloves,
and I never eat lunch.  But I'll offer to go, if anybody else
will.  When I come to think of it, I'm not at all sure that I
wasn't his most particular friend; for we used to stop and
speak whenever we met.  By-by!"
</p>

<p>
Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with
other groups.  Scrooge knew the men, and looked toward the
Spirit for an explanation.
</p>

<p>
The Phantom glided on into a street.  Its finger pointed
to two persons meeting.  Scrooge listened again, thinking
that the explanation might lie here.
</p>

<p>
He knew these men, also, perfectly.  They were men of
business: very wealthy, and of great importance.  He had
made a point always of standing well in their esteem: in a
business point of view, that is; strictly in a business point
of view.
</p>

<p>
"How are you?" said one.
</p>

<p>
"How are you?" returned the other.
</p>

<p>
"Well!" said the first.  "Old Scratch has got his own at
last, hey?"
</p>

<p>
"So I am told," returned the second.  "Cold, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Seasonable for Christmas time.  You're not a skater, I
suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  No.  Something else to think of.  Good-morning!"
</p>

<p>
Not another word.  That was their meeting, their
conversation, and their parting.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the
Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently
so trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some
hidden purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely
to be.  They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing
on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and
this Ghost's province was the Future.  Nor could he think
of any one immediately connected with himself to whom
he could apply them.  But nothing doubting that to whomsoever
they applied they had some latent moral for his own
improvement, he resolved to treasure up every word he
heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the
shadow of himself when it appeared.  For he had an
expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him
the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these
riddles easy.
</p>

<p>
He looked about in that very place for his own image;
but another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though
the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there,
he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that
poured in through the Porch.  It gave him little surprise,
however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of
life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions
carried out in this.
</p>

<p>
Quiet and dark beside him stood the Phantom, with its
outstretched hand.  When he roused himself from his
thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and
its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes
were looking at him keenly.  It made him shudder, and feel
very cold.
</p>

<p>
They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure
part of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before,
although he recognized its situation, and its bad repute.
The ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses
wretched; the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.
Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their
offenses of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling
streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime; with filth,
and misery.
</p>

<p>
Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed,
beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron,
old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought.
Upon the floor within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys,
nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of
all kinds.  Secrets that few would like to scrutinize were
bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of
corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones.  Sitting in among
the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal-stove, made of old
bricks, was a gray-haired rascal, nearly seventy years of age;
who had screened himself from the cold air without by a
frowsy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line;
and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this
man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the
shop.  But she had scarcely entered, when another woman,
similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed
by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the
sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of
each other.  After a short period of blank astonishment, in
which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all
three burst into a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Let the charwoman alone to be the first!" cried she
who had entered first.  "Let the laundress alone to be the
second; and let the undertaker's man alone to be the third.
Look here, old Joe, here's a chance!  If we haven't all three
met here without meaning it!"
</p>

<p>
"You couldn't have met in a better place," said old Joe,
removing his pipe from his mouth.  "Come into the parlor.
You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other
two an't strangers.  Stop till I shut the door of the shop.
Ah!  How it skreeks!  There an't such a rusty bit of metal
in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's
no such old bones here as mine.  Ha, ha!  We're all suitable
to our calling, we're well matched.  Come into the parlor.
Come into the parlor."
</p>

<p>
The parlor was the space behind the screen of rags.  The
old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and
having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night) with the
stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.
</p>

<p>
While he did this, the woman who had already spoken
threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting
manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and
looking with a bold defiance at the other two.
</p>

<p>
"What odds then!  What odds, Mrs. Dilber?" said the
woman.  "Every person has a right to take care of
themselves.  <i>He</i> always did!"
</p>

<p>
"That's true, indeed!" said the laundress.  "No man more
so."
</p>

<p>
"Why, then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid,
woman; who's the wiser?  We're not going to pick holes in
each other's coats, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed!" said Mrs. Dilber and the man together.
"We should hope not."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then!" cried the woman.  "That's enough.
Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these?
Not a dead man, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed," said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked
old screw," pursued the woman, "why wasn't he natural in
his lifetime?  If he had been, he'd have had somebody to
look after him when he was struck with Death, instead of
lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself."
</p>

<p>
"It's the truest word that ever was spoke," said
Mrs. Dilber.  "It's a judgment on him."
</p>

<p>
"I wish it was a little heavier one," replied the woman;
"and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I
could have laid my hands on anything else.  Open that
bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it.  Speak out
plain.  I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to
see it.  We knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves,
before we met here, I believe.  It's no sin.  Open the bundle,
Joe."
</p>

<p>
But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this;
and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first,
produced his plunder.  It was not extensive.  A seal or two, a
pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no
great value, were all.  They were severally examined and
appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed
to give for each upon the wall, and added them up into
a total when he found there was nothing more to come.
</p>

<p>
"That's your account," said Joe, "and I wouldn't give another
sixpence if I was to be boiled for not doing it.  Who's
next?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Dilber was next.  Sheets and towels, a little wearing
apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of
sugar-tongs, and a few boots.  Her account was stated on
the wall in the same manner.
</p>

<p>
"I always give too much to ladies.  It's a weakness of
mine, and that's the way I ruin myself," said old Joe.  "That's
your account.  If you asked me for another penny, and
made it an open question, I'd repent of being so liberal and
knock off half-a-crown."
</p>

<p>
"And now undo my bundle, Joe," said the first woman.
</p>

<p>
Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience
of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots,
dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.
</p>

<p>
"What do you call this?" said Joe.  "Bed-curtains!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward
on her crossed arms.  "Bed-curtains!"
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean to say you took 'em down, rings and all,
with him lying there?" said Joe.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do," replied the woman.  "Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"You were born to make your fortune," said Joe, "and
you'll certainly do it."
</p>

<p>
"I certainly shan't hold my hand when I can get anything
in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was,
I promise you, Joe," returned the woman coolly.  "Don't
drop that oil upon the blankets, now."
</p>

<p>
"His blankets?" asked Joe.
</p>

<p>
"Whose else's do you think?" replied the woman.  "He
isn't likely to take cold without 'em, I dare say."
</p>

<p>
"I hope he didn't die of anything catching, eh?" said old
Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you be afraid of that," returned the woman.  "I
an't so fond of his company that I'd loiter about him for such
things, if he did.  Ah! you may look through that shirt till
your eyes ache; but you won't find a hole in it, nor a threadbare
place.  It's the best he had, and a fine one too.  They'd
have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me."
</p>

<p>
"What do you call wasting of it?" asked old Joe.
</p>

<p>
"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure," replied the
woman with a laugh.  "Somebody was fool enough to do it,
but I took it off again.  If calico an't good enough for such
a purpose, it isn't good enough for anything.  It's quite as
becoming to the body.  He can't look uglier than he did in
that one."
</p>

<p>
Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror.  As they sat
grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the
old man's lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and
disgust which could hardly have been greater, though they had
been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha!" laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing
a flannel bag with money in it, told out their several
gains upon the ground.  "This is the end of it, you see!  He
frightened every one away from him when he was alive, to
profit us when he was dead!  Ha, ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
"Spirit!" said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot.  "I
see, I see.  The case of this unhappy man might be my own.
My life tends that way, now.  Merciful Heaven, what is
this!"
</p>

<p>
He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and
now he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on
which, beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered
up, which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful
language.
</p>

<p>
The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with
any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience
to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it
was.  A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon
the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched,
unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge glanced toward the Phantom.  Its steady hand
was pointed to the head.  The cover was so carelessly
adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger
upon Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the face.  He
thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed
to do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to
dismiss the spectre at his side.
</p>

<p>
Oh, cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar
here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy
command: for this is thy dominion!  But of the loved, revered,
and honored head, thou canst not turn one hair to thy
dread purposes, or make one feature odious.  It is not that
the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it is not
that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was
open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender;
and the pulse a man's.  Strike, Shadow, strike!  And see his
good deeds springing from the wound, to sow the world with
life immortal!
</p>

<p>
No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and
yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed.  He thought,
if this man could be raised up now, what would be his foremost
thoughts?  Avarice, hard dealing, griping cares?  They
have brought him to a rich end, truly!
</p>

<p>
He lay in the dark, empty house, with not a man, a woman,
or a child to say that he was kind to me in this or that, and
for the memory of one kind word I will be kind to him.  A
cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of
gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone.  What they wanted in the
room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed,
Scrooge did not dare to think.
</p>

<p>
"Spirit!" he said, "this is a fearful place.  In leaving it,
I shall not leave its lesson, trust me.  Let us go!"
</p>

<p>
Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the
head.
</p>

<p>
"I understand you," Scrooge returned, "and I would do it,
if I could.  But I have not the power, Spirit.  I have not the
power."
</p>

<p>
Again it seemed to look upon him.
</p>

<p>
"If there is any person in the town who feels emotion
caused by this man's death," said Scrooge, quite agonized,
"show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!"
</p>

<p>
The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment,
like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room by
daylight, where a mother and her children were.
</p>

<p>
She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness;
for she walked up and down the room; started at every
sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock;
tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly
bear the voices of the children in their play.
</p>

<p>
At length the long-expected knock was heard.  She
hurried to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face
was careworn and depressed, though he was young.  There
was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious
delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled
to repress.
</p>

<p>
He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for
him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news
(which was not until after a long silence), he appeared
embarrassed how to answer.
</p>

<p>
"Is it good," she said, "or bad?"&mdash;to help him.
</p>

<p>
"Bad," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"We are quite ruined?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  There is hope yet, Caroline."
</p>

<p>
"If <i>he</i> relents," she said, amazed, "there is!  Nothing is
past hope, if such a miracle has happened."
</p>

<p>
"He is past relenting," said her husband.  "He is dead."
</p>

<p>
She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke
truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she
said so, with clasped hands.  She prayed forgiveness the
next moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion
of her heart.
</p>

<p>
"What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last
night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a
week's delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to
avoid me; turns out to have been quite true.  He was not
only very ill, but dying, then."
</p>

<p>
"To whom will our debt be transferred?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  But before that time we shall be ready
with the money; and even though we were not, it would be
bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his
successor.  We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!"
</p>

<p>
Yes.  Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter.
The children's faces, hushed, and clustered round to hear
what they so little understood, were brighter; and it was
a happier house for this man's death!  The only emotion that
the Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of
pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,"
said Scrooge; "or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left
just now, will be forever present to me."
</p>

<p>
The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar
to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and
there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen.  They
entered poor Bob Cratchit's house; the dwelling he had
visited before; and found the mother and the children seated
round the fire.
</p>

<p>
Quiet.  Very quiet.  The noisy little Cratchits were as
still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter,
who had a book before him.  The mother and her daughters
were engaged in sewing.  But surely they were very quiet!
</p>

<p>
"'And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.'"
</p>

<p>
Where had Scrooge heard those words?  He had not
dreamed them.  The boy must have read them out, as he
and the Spirit crossed the threshold.  Why did he not go on?
The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her
hand up to her face.
</p>

<p>
"The color hurts my eyes," she said.
</p>

<p>
The color?  Ah, poor Tiny Tim!
</p>

<p>
"They're better now again," said Cratchit's wife.  "It
makes them weak by candlelight; and I wouldn't show weak
eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world.  It
must be near his time."
</p>

<p>
"Past it rather," Peter answered, shutting up his book.
"But I think he's walked a little slower than he used, these
few last evenings, mother."
</p>

<p>
They were very quiet again.  At last she said, and in a
steady cheerful voice, that only faltered once:
</p>

<p>
"I have known him walk with&mdash;I have known him walk
with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed."
</p>

<p>
"And so have I," cried Peter.  "Often."
</p>

<p>
"And so have I," exclaimed another.  So had all.
</p>

<p>
"But he was very light to carry," she resumed, intent upon
her work, "and his father loved him so, that it was no
trouble&mdash;no trouble.  And there is your father at the door!"
</p>

<p>
She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his
comforter&mdash;he had need of it, poor fellow&mdash;came in.  His tea was
ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help
him to it most.  Then the two young Cratchits got upon his
knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against his face, as
if they said, "Don't mind it, father.  Don't be grieved!"
</p>

<p>
Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly
to all the family.  He looked at the work upon the table, and
praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls.
They would be done long before Sunday he said.
</p>

<p>
"Sunday?  You went to-day, then, Robert?" said his wife.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my dear," returned Bob.  "I wish you could have
gone.  It would have done you good to see how green a place
it is.  But you'll see it often.  I promised him that I would
walk there on a Sunday.  My little, little child!" cried Bob.
"My little child!"
</p>

<p>
He broke down all at once.  He couldn't help it.  If he
could have helped it, he and his child would have been
further apart perhaps than they were.
</p>

<p>
He left the room, and went upstairs into the room above,
which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas.
There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were
signs of some one having been there, lately.  Poor Bob sat
down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed
himself, he kissed the little face.  He was reconciled to what
had happened, and went down again quite happy.
</p>

<p>
They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and
mother working still.  Bob told them of the extraordinary
kindness of Mr. Scrooge's nephew, whom he had scarcely
seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day,
and seeing that he looked a little&mdash;"just a little down you
know," said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress
him.  "On which," said Bob, "for he is the pleasantest-spoken
gentleman you ever heard, I told him.  'I am heartily
sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,' he said, 'and heartily sorry for
your good wife.'  By the by, how he ever knew that, I don't
know."
</p>

<p>
"Knew what, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, that you were a good wife," replied Bob.
</p>

<p>
"Everybody knows that!" said Peter.
</p>

<p>
"Very well observed, my boy!" cried Bob.  "I hope they
do.  'Heartily sorry,' he said, 'for your good wife.  If I can
be of service to you in any way,' he said, giving me his card,
'that's where I live.  Pray come to me.'  Now, it wasn't," cried
Bob, "for the sake of anything he might be able to do for
us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful.
It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and
felt with us."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure he's a good soul!" said Mrs. Cratchit.
</p>

<p>
"You would be surer of it, my dear," returned Bob, "if
you saw and spoke to him.  I shouldn't be at all surprised,
mark what I say, if he got Peter a better situation."
</p>

<p>
"Only hear that, Peter," said Mrs. Cratchit.
</p>

<p>
"And then," cried one of the girls, "Peter will be keeping
company with some one, and setting up for himself."
</p>

<p>
"Get along with you!" retorted Peter, grinning.
</p>

<p>
"It's just as likely as not," said Bob, "one of these days;
though there's plenty of time for that, my dear.  But
however and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we
shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim&mdash;shall we&mdash;or this
first parting that there was among us?"
</p>

<p>
"Never, father!" cried they all.
</p>

<p>
"And I know," said Bob, "I know, my dears, that when
we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he
was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among
ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it."
</p>

<p>
"No, never, father!" they all cried again.
</p>

<p>
"I am very happy," said little Bob, "I am very happy!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the
two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself
shook hands.  Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was
from God!
</p>

<p>
"Spectre," said Scrooge, "something informs me that our
parting moment is at hand.  I know it, but I know not how.
Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?"
</p>

<p>
The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as
before&mdash;though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there
seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were
in the Future&mdash;into the resorts of business men, but showed
him not himself.  Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything,
but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until
besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"This court," said Scrooge, "through which we hurry now,
is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length
of time.  I see the house.  Let me behold what I shall be, in
days to come!"
</p>

<p>
The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
"The house is yonder," Scrooge exclaimed.  "Why do you
point away?"
</p>

<p>
The inexorable finger underwent no change.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked
in.  It was an office still, but not his.  The furniture was not
the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself.  The
Phantom pointed as before.
</p>

<p>
He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither
he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate.
He paused to look round before entering.
</p>

<p>
A churchyard.  Here, then, the wretched man whose name
he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground.  It was a
worthy place.  Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and
weeds, the growth of vegetation's death, not life; choked up
with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite.  A worthy
place!
</p>

<p>
The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to
One.  He advanced toward it trembling.  The Phantom was
exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new
meaning in its solemn shape.
</p>

<p>
"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,"
said Scrooge, "answer me one question.  Are these the shadows
of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things
that May be, only?"
</p>

<p>
Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which
it stood.
</p>

<p>
"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if
persevered in, they must lead," said Scrooge.  "But if the
courses be departed from, the ends will change.  Say it is
thus with what you show me!"
</p>

<p>
The Spirit was immovable as ever.
</p>

<p>
Scrooge crept toward it, trembling as he went; and following
the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave
his own name, "Ebenezer Scrooge."
</p>

<p>
"Am <i>I</i> that man who lay upon the bed?" he cried, upon
his knees.
</p>

<p>
The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.
</p>

<p>
"No, Spirit!  Oh, no, no!"
</p>

<p>
The finger still was there.
</p>

<p>
"Spirit!" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, "hear me!
I am not the man I was.  I will not be the man I must have
been but for this intercourse.  Why show me this, if I am
past all hope!"
</p>

<p>
For the first time the hand appeared to shake.
</p>

<p>
"Good Spirit," he pursued, as down upon the ground he
fell before it: "Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me.
Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have
shown me, by an altered life!"
</p>

<p>
The kind hand trembled.
</p>

<p>
"I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all
the year.  I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future.
The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me.  I will
not shut out the lessons that they teach.  Oh, tell me I may
sponge away the writing on this stone!"
</p>

<p>
In his agony, he caught the spectral hand.  It sought to
free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it.
The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.
</p>

<p>
Holding up his hand in one last prayer to have his fate
reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom's hood
and dress.  It shrank, collapsed, and dwindled down into
a bed-post.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
STAVE FIVE
</p>

<p class="t3">
<i>The End of It</i>
</p>

<p>
Yes! and the bedpost was his own.  The bed was his own,
the room was his own.  Best and happiest of all, the Time
before him was his own, to make amends in!
</p>

<p>
"I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!"
Scrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed.  "The Spirits
of all Three shall strive within me.  Oh, Jacob Marley!
Heaven, and the Christmas Time be praised for this!  I
say it on my knees, old Jacob, on my knees!"
</p>

<p>
He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions,
that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his
call.  He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the
Spirit, and his face was wet with tears.
</p>

<p>
"They are not torn down," cried Scrooge, folding one of
his bed-curtains in his arms, "they are not torn down, rings
and all.  They are here: I am here: the shadows of the
things that would have been may be dispelled.  They will be.
I know they will!"
</p>

<p>
His hands were busy with his garments all this time:
turning them inside out, putting them on upside down,
tearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to every
kind of extravagance.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what to do!" cried Scrooge, laughing and
crying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laocoön
of himself with his stockings.  "I am as light as a feather,
I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy.
I am as giddy as a drunken man.  A Merry Christmas to
everybody!  A Happy New Year to all the world.  Hallo
here!  Whoop!  Hallo!"
</p>

<p>
He had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing
there: perfectly winded.
</p>

<p>
"There's the saucepan that the gruel was in!" cried
Scrooge, starting off again, and frisking round the fireplace.
"There's the door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley
entered!  There's the corner where the Ghost of Christmas
Present sat!  There's the window where I saw the wandering
Spirits!  It's all right, it's all true, it all happened.  Ha,
ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
Really, for a man who had been out of practise for so
many years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious
laugh.  The father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs!
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what day of the month it is!" said Scrooge.
"I don't know how long I've been among the Spirits.  I
don't know anything.  I'm quite a baby.  Never mind.  I
don't care.  I'd rather be a baby.  Hallo!  Whoop!  Hallo
here!"
</p>

<p>
He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing
out the lustiest peals he had ever heard.  Clash, clang,
hammer, ding, dong, bell.  Bell, dong, ding, hammer, clang,
clash!  Oh, glorious, glorious!
</p>

<p>
Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his
head.  No fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold;
cold, piping for the blood to dance to; golden sunlight;
heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells.  Oh, glorious.
Glorious!
</p>

<p>
"What's to-day?" cried Scrooge, calling downward to a
boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look
about him.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?" returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.
</p>

<p>
"What's to-day, my fine fellow?" said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"To-day!" replied the boy.  "Why, CHRISTMAS DAY."
</p>

<p>
"It's Christmas Day!" said Scrooge to himself.  "I haven't
missed it.  The Spirits have done it all in one night.  They
can do anything they like.  Of course they can.  Of course
they can.  Hallo, my fine fellow!"
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" returned the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know the Poulterer's, in the next street but one,
at the corner?" Scrooge inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I should hope I did," replied the lad.
</p>

<p>
"An intelligent boy!" said Scrooge.  "A remarkable boy!
Do you know whether they've sold the prize turkey that was
hanging up there?  Not the little prize turkey: the big one?"
</p>

<p>
"What, the one as big as me?" returned the boy.
</p>

<p>
"What a delightful boy!" said Scrooge.  "It's a pleasure
to talk to him.  Yes, my buck!"
</p>

<p>
"It's hanging there now," replied the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Is it?" said Scrooge.  "Go and buy it."
</p>

<p>
"Walk-<i>er</i>!" exclaimed the boy.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," said Scrooge, "I am in earnest.  Go and buy it,
and tell 'em to bring it here, that I may give them the
direction where to take it.  Come back with the man, and
I'll give you a shilling.  Come back with him in less than
five minutes, and I'll give you half-a-crown!"
</p>

<p>
The boy was off like a shot.  He must have had a steady
hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.
</p>

<p>
"I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's!" whispered Scrooge, rubbing
his hands, and splitting with a laugh.  "He shan't know
who sends it.  It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.  Joe Miller
never made such a joke as sending it to Bob's will be!"
</p>

<p>
The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady
one, but write it he did, somehow, and went downstairs to
open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer's
man.  As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker
caught his eye.
</p>

<p>
"I shall love it, as long as I live!" cried Scrooge, patting
it with his hand.  "I scarcely ever looked at it before.  What
an honest expression it has in its face!  It's a wonderful
knocker!&mdash;Here's the Turkey.  Hallo!  Whoop!  How are
you!  Merry Christmas!"
</p>

<p>
It <i>was</i> a Turkey!  He could never have stood upon his
legs, that bird.  He would have snapped 'em short off in a
minute, like sticks of sealing-wax.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,"
said Scrooge.  "You must have a cab."
</p>

<p>
The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle
with which he paid for the turkey, and the chuckle with
which he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he
recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by the
chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair
again, and chuckled till he cried.
</p>

<p>
Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to
shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when
you don't dance while you are at it.  But if he had cut the
end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of
sticking-plaster over it, and been quite satisfied.
</p>

<p>
He dressed himself "all in his best," and at last got out
into the streets.  The people were by this time pouring forth,
as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present;
and walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded
every one with a delighted smile.  He looked so irresistibly
pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humored fellows
said: "Good-morning, sir!  A Merry Christmas to you!"  And
Scrooge said often afterward, that of all the blithe
sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.
</p>

<p>
He had not gone far, when coming on toward him he
beheld the portly gentleman who had walked into his
counting-house the day before and said: "Scrooge and Marley's, I
believe?"  It sent a pang across his heart to think how this
old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he
knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.
</p>

<p>
"My dear sir," said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and
taking the old gentleman by both his hands.  "How do you do?
I hope you succeeded yesterday.  It was very kind of you.
A Merry Christmas to you, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Scrooge?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Scrooge.  "That is my name, and I fear it
may not be pleasant to you.  Allow me to ask your pardon.
And will you have the goodness"&mdash;here Scrooge whispered
in his ear.
</p>

<p>
"Lord bless me!" cried the gentleman, as if his breath
were gone.  "My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?"
</p>

<p>
"If you please," said Scrooge.  "Not a farthing less.
A great many back-payments are included in it, I assure
you.  Will you do me that favor?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear sir," said the other, shaking hands with him.
"I don't know what to say to such munifi&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't say anything, please," retorted Scrooge.  "Come
and see me.  Will you come and see me?"
</p>

<p>
"I will!" cried the old gentleman.  And it was clear he
meant to do it.
</p>

<p>
"Thank'ee," said Scrooge.  "I am much obliged to you.
I thank you fifty times.  Bless you!"
</p>

<p>
He went to church, and walked about the streets, and
watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children
on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into
the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows; and found
that everything could yield him pleasure.  He had never
dreamed that any walk&mdash;that anything&mdash;could give him so
much happiness.  In the afternoon, he turned his steps
toward his nephew's house.
</p>

<p>
He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the
courage to go up and knock.  But he made a dash, and
did it:
</p>

<p>
"Is your master at home, my dear?" said Scrooge to the
girl.  Nice girl!  Very.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Where is he, my love?" said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
"He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress.  I'll
show you upstairs, if you please."
</p>

<p>
"Thank'ee.  He knows me," said Scrooge, with his
hand already on the dining-room lock.  "I'll go in here,
my dear."
</p>

<p>
He turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the
door.  They were looking at the table (which was spread out
in great array); for these young housekeepers are always
nervous on such points, and like to see that everything is
right.
</p>

<p>
"Fred!" said Scrooge.
</p>

<p>
Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started!
Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting
in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn't have done it,
on any account.
</p>

<p>
"Why, bless my soul!" cried Fred, "who's that?"
</p>

<p>
"It's I.  Your uncle Scrooge.  I have come to dinner.
Will you let me in, Fred?"
</p>

<p>
Let him in!  It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off.
He was at home in five minutes.  Nothing could be heartier.
His niece looked just the same.  So did Topper when <i>he</i>
came.  So did the plump sister, when <i>she</i> came.  So did every
one when <i>they</i> came.  Wonderful party, wonderful games,
wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!
</p>

<p>
But he was early at the office next morning.  Oh, he was
early there.  If he could only be there first, and catch Bob
Cratchit coming late!  That was the thing he had set his
heart upon.
</p>

<p>
And he did it; yes he did!  The clock struck nine.  No
Bob.  A quarter past.  No Bob.  He was full eighteen minutes
and a half behind his time.  Scrooge sat with his door
wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.
</p>

<p>
His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter
too.  He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his
pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o'clock.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice as
near as he could feign it.  "What do you mean by coming
here at this time of day?"
</p>

<p>
"I am very sorry, sir," said Bob.  "I am behind my time."
</p>

<p>
"You are?" repeated Scrooge.  "Yes.  I think you are.
Step this way, sir, if you please."
</p>

<p>
"It's only once a year, sir," pleaded Bob, appearing from
the Tank.  "It shall not be repeated.  I was making rather
merry yesterday, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Now, I'll tell you what, my friend," said Scrooge, "I am
not going to stand this sort of thing any longer.  And
therefore," he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving Bob
such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the
Tank again: "and therefore I am about to raise your salary!"
</p>

<p>
Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler.  He
had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it;
holding him; and calling to the people in the court for
help and a strait-waistcoat.
</p>

<p>
"A Merry Christmas, Bob!" said Scrooge, with an earnestness
that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the
back.  "A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I
have given you for many a year!  I'll raise your salary, and
endeavor to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss
your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl
of smoking bishop, Bob!  Make up the fires, and buy another
coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!"
</p>

<p>
Scrooge was better than his word.  He did it all, and
infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did <i>not</i> die, he was a
second father.  He became as good a friend, as good a
master, and as good a man, as the good old City knew, or any
other good old city, town, or borough in the good old world.
Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he
let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise
enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe,
for good, at which some people did not have their fill of
laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these
would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they
should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in
less attractive forms.  His own heart laughed: and that was
quite enough for him.
</p>

<p>
He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived
upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterward; and it
was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas
well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge.  May that
be truly said of us, and all of us!  And so, as Tiny Tim

</p>

<p>
On the summit of one of the heights of the
Odenwald, a wild and romantic tract of Upper Germany
that lies not far from the confluence of the Maine
and the Rhine, there stood, many, many years
since, the Castle of the Baron Von Landshort.  It is now
quite fallen to decay, and almost buried among beech trees
and dark firs; above which, however, its old watch-tower
may still be seen struggling, like the former possessor I
have mentioned, to carry a high head, and look down upon
a neighboring country.
</p>

<p>
The Baron was a dry branch of the great family of
Katzenellenbogen,* and inherited the relics of the property and
all the pride of his ancestors.  Though the warlike disposition
of his predecessors had much impaired the family possessions,
yet the Baron still endeavored to keep up some
show of former state.  The times were peaceable, and the
German nobles, in general, had abandoned their inconvenient
old castles, perched like eagles' nests among the mountains,
and had built more convenient residences in the valleys;
still the Baron remained proudly drawn up in his little
fortress, cherishing with hereditary inveteracy all the old
family feuds; so that he was on ill terms with some of his
nearest neighbors, on account of disputes that had happened
between their great-great-grandfathers.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* <i>I.e., Cat's Elbow</i>&mdash;the name of a family
of those parts, very powerful in
former times.  The appellation, we are told,
was given in compliment to a
peerless dame of the family, celebrated for a fine arm.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The Baron had but one child, a daughter; but Nature,
when she grants but one child, always compensates by
making it a prodigy; and so it was with the daughter of the
Baron.  All the nurses, gossips, and country cousins, assured
her father that she had not her equal for beauty in all
Germany; and who should know better than they?  She had,
moreover, been brought up with great care, under the
superintendence of two maiden aunts, who had spent some years
of their early life at one of the little German courts, and
were skilled in all the branches of knowledge necessary to
the education of a fine lady.  Under their instructions, she
became a miracle of accomplishments.  By the time she was
eighteen she could embroider to admiration, and had worked
whole histories of the saints in tapestry with such strength
of expression in their countenances that they looked like so
many souls in purgatory.  She could read without great
difficulty, and had spelled her way through several church
legends, and almost all the chivalric wonders of the Heldenbuch.
She had even made considerable proficiency in writing,
could sign her own name without missing a letter,
and so legibly that her aunts could read it without
spectacles.  She excelled in making little good-for-nothing
lady-like knickknacks of all kinds; was versed in the most
abstruse dancing of the day; played a number of airs on the
harp and guitar; and knew all the tender ballads of the
Minnie-lieders by heart.
</p>

<p>
Her aunts, too, having been great flirts and coquettes in
their younger days, were admirably calculated to be vigilant
guardians and strict censors of the conduct of their niece;
for there is no duenna so rigidly prudent, and inexorably
decorous, as a superannuated coquette.  She was rarely
suffered out of their sight; never went beyond the domains of
the castle, unless well attended, or, rather, well watched;
had continual lectures read to her about strict decorum and
implicit obedience; and, as to the men&mdash;pah! she was taught
to hold them at such distance and distrust that, unless
properly authorized, she would not have cast a glance upon the
handsomest cavalier in the world&mdash;no, not if he were even
dying at her feet.
</p>

<p>
The good effects of this system were wonderfully apparent.
The young lady was a pattern of docility and correctness.
While others were wasting their sweetness in the
glare of the world, and liable to be plucked and thrown
aside by every hand, she was coyly blooming into fresh and
lovely womanhood under the protection of those immaculate
spinsters, like a rose-bud blushing forth among guardian
thorns.  Her aunts looked upon her with pride and exultation,
and vaunted that though all the other young ladies in
the world might go astray, yet, thank Heaven, nothing of the
kind could happen to the heiress of Katzenellenbogen.
</p>

<p>
But however scantily the Baron Von Landshort might be
provided with children, his household was by no means a
small one, for Providence had enriched him with abundance
of poor relations.  They, one and all, possessed the
affectionate disposition common to humble relatives; were
wonderfully attached to the Baron, and took every possible
occasion to come in swarms and enliven the castle.  All family
festivals were commemorated by these good people at the
Baron's expense; and when they were filled with good cheer,
they would declare that there was nothing on earth so
delightful as these family meetings, these jubilees of the heart.
</p>

<p>
The Baron, though a small man, had a large soul, and it
swelled with satisfaction at the consciousness of being the
greatest man in the little world about him.  He loved to tell
long stories about the stark old warriors whose portraits
looked grimly down from the walls around, and he found
no listeners equal to those who fed at his expense.  He was
much given to the marvelous, and a firm believer in all those
supernatural tales with which every mountain and valley in
Germany abounds.  The faith of his guests even exceeded
his own: they listened to every tale of wonder with open
eyes and mouth, and never failed to be astonished, even
though repeated for the hundredth time.  Thus lived the
Baron Von Landshort, the oracle of his table, the absolute
monarch of his little territory, and happy, above all things,
in the persuasion that he was the wisest man of the age.
</p>

<p>
At the time of which my story treats there was a great
family gathering at the castle, on an affair of the utmost
importance: it was to receive the destined bridegroom of the
Baron's daughter.  A negotiation had been carried on
between the father and an old nobleman of Bavaria, to unite
the dignity of their houses by the marriage of their children.
The preliminaries had been conducted with proper punctilio.
The young people were betrothed without seeing each other,
and the time was appointed for the marriage ceremony.  The
young Count Von Altenburg had been recalled from the army
for the purpose, and was actually on his way to the Baron's
to receive his bride.  Missives had even been received from
him, from Wurtzburg, where he was accidentally detained,
mentioning the day and hour when he might be expected
to arrive.
</p>

<p>
The castle was in a tumult of preparation to give him a
suitable welcome.  The fair bride had been decked out with
uncommon care.  The two aunts had superintended her toilet,
and quarreled the whole morning about every article of her
dress.  The young lady had taken advantage of their contest
to follow the bent of her own taste; and fortunately it was a
good one.  She looked as lovely as youthful bridegroom could
desire; and the flutter of expectation heightened the lustre
of her charms.
</p>

<p>
The suffusions that mantled her face and neck, the gentle
heaving of the bosom, the eye now and then lost in reverie,
all betrayed the soft tumult that was going on in her little
heart.  The aunts were continually hovering around her; for
maiden aunts are apt to take great interest in affairs of
this nature: they were giving her a world of staid counsel
how to deport herself, what to say, and in what manner to
receive the expected lover.
</p>

<p>
The Baron was no less busied in preparations.  He had,
in truth, nothing exactly to do; but he was naturally a
fuming, bustling little man, and could not remain passive when
all the world was in a hurry.  He worried from top to bottom
of the castle, with an air of infinite anxiety; he continually
called the servants from their work to exhort them to be
diligent, and buzzed about every hall and chamber, as idly,
restless, and importunate as a bluebottle fly of a warm
summer's day.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, the fatted calf had been killed; the
forests had rung with the clamor of the huntsmen; the kitchen
was crowded with good cheer; the cellars had yielded up
whole oceans of <i>Rhein-wein</i> and <i>Ferne-wein</i>, and even the
great Heidelberg Tun had been laid under contribution.
Everything was ready to receive the distinguished guest with
<i>Saus and Braus</i> in the true spirit of German hospitality&mdash;but
the guest delayed to make his appearance.  Hour rolled after
hour.  The sun that had poured his downward rays upon
the rich forests of the Odenwald, now just gleamed along
the summits of the mountains.  The Baron mounted the
highest tower, and strained his eyes in hopes of catching a
distant sight of the Count and his attendants.  Once he
thought he beheld them; the sound of horns came floating
from the valley, prolonged by the mountain echoes: a number
of horsemen were seen far below, slowly advancing along the
road; but when they had nearly reached the foot of the
mountain they suddenly struck off in a different direction.
The last ray of sunshine departed&mdash;the boats began to flit by
in the twilight&mdash;the road grew dimmer and dimmer to the
view; and nothing appeared stirring in it but now and then
a peasant lagging homeward from his labor.
</p>

<p>
While the old castle of Landshort was in this state of
perplexity, a very interesting scene was transacting in a
different part of the Odenwald.
</p>

<p>
The young Count Von Altenburg was tranquilly pursuing
his route in that sober jog-trot way in which a man travels
toward matrimony when his friends have taken all the
trouble and uncertainty of courtship off his hands, and a bride
is waiting for him, as certainly as a dinner, at the end of his
journey.  He had encountered at Wurtzburg a youthful
companion in arms, with whom he had seen some service on the
frontiers: Herman Von Starkenfaust, one of the stoutest
hands and worthiest hearts of German chivalry, who was
now returning from the army.  His father's castle was not
far distant from the old fortress of Landshort, although a
hereditary feud rendered the families hostile and strangers to
each other.
</p>

<p>
In the warm-hearted moment of recognition, the young
friends related all their past adventures and fortunes, and
the Count gave the whole history of his intended nuptials
with a young lady whom he had never seen, but of whose
charms he had received the most enrapturing descriptions.
</p>

<p>
As the route of the friends lay in the same direction, they
agreed to perform the rest of their journey together; and,
that they might do it more leisurely, set off from Wurtzburg
at an early hour, the Count having given directions for his
retinue to follow and overtake him.
</p>

<p>
They beguiled their wayfaring with recollections of their
military scenes and adventures; but the Count was apt to be
a little tedious, now and then, about the reputed charms of
his bride, and the felicity that awaited him.
</p>

<p>
In this way they had entered among the mountains of the
Odenwald, and were traversing one of its most lonely and
thickly wooded passes.  It is well known that the forests
of Germany have always been as much infested with robbers
as its castles by spectres; and, at this time, the former were
particularly numerous, from the hordes of disbanded soldiers
wandering about the country.  It will not appear extraordinary,
therefore, that the cavaliers were attacked by a gang
of these stragglers in the midst of the forest.  They defended
themselves with bravery, but were nearly overpowered when
the Count's retinue arrived to their assistance.  At sight of
them the robbers fled, but not until the Count had received
a mortal wound.  He was slowly and carefully conveyed back
to the city of Wurtzburg, and a friar summoned from a neighboring
convent, who was famous for his skill in administering
to both soul and body.  But half of his skill was superfluous;
the moments of the unfortunate Count were numbered.
</p>

<p>
With his dying breath he entreated his friend to repair
instantly to the castle of Landshort, and explain the fatal
cause of his not keeping his appointment with his bride.
Though not the most ardent of lovers, he was one of the most
punctilious of men, and appeared earnestly solicitous that
this mission should be speedily and courteously executed.
"Unless this is done," said he, "I shall not sleep quietly in
my grave!"  He repeated these last words with peculiar
solemnity.  A request, at a moment so impressive, admitted
no hesitation.  Starkenfaust endeavored to soothe him to
calmness; promised faithfully to execute his wish, and gave
him his hand in solemn pledge.  The dying man pressed it in
acknowledgment, but soon lapsed into delirium&mdash;raved about
his bride&mdash;his engagements&mdash;his plighted word; ordered his
horse, that he might ride to the castle of Landshort, and
expired in the fancied act of vaulting into the saddle.
</p>

<p>
Starkenfaust bestowed a sigh and a soldier's tear on the
untimely fate of his comrade; and then pondered on the
awkward mission he had undertaken.  His heart was heavy,
and his head perplexed; for he was to present himself an
unbidden guest among hostile people, and to damp their
festivity with tidings fatal to their hopes.  Still there were
certain whisperings of curiosity in his bosom to see this
far-famed beauty of Katzenellenbogen so cautiously shut up
from the world; for he was a passionate admirer of the sex,
and there was a dash of eccentricity and enterprise in his
character that made him fond of all singular adventure.
</p>

<p>
Previous to his departure, he made all due arrangements
with the holy fraternity of the convent for the funeral
solemnities of his friend, who was to be buried in the cathedral
of Wurtzburg, near some of his illustrious relatives; and
the mourning retinue of the Count took charge of his
remains.
</p>

<p>
It is now high time that we should return to the ancient
family of Katzenellenbogen, who were impatient for their
guest, and still more for their dinner; and to the worthy little
Baron, whom we left airing himself on the watch-tower.
</p>

<p>
Night closed in, but still no guest arrived.  The Baron
descended from the tower in despair.  The banquet, which
had been delayed from hour to hour, could no longer be
postponed.  The meats were already overdone, the cook in an
agony, and the whole household had the look of a garrison
that had been reduced by famine.  The Baron was obliged
reluctantly to give orders for the feast without the presence
of the guest.  All were seated at table, and just on the point
of commencing, when the sound of a horn from without the
gate gave notice of the approach of a stranger.  Another
long blast filled the old courts of the castle with its echoes,
and was answered by the warder from the walls.  The Baron
hastened to receive his future son-in-law.
</p>

<p>
The drawbridge had been let down, and the stranger was
before the gate.  He was a tall gallant cavalier, mounted on
a black steed.  His countenance was pale, but he had a
beaming, romantic eye, and an air of stately melancholy.
The Baron was a little mortified that he should have come
in this simple, solitary style.  His dignity for a moment was
ruffled, and he felt disposed to consider it a want of proper
respect for the important occasion, and the important family
with which he was to be connected.  He pacified himself,
however, with the conclusion that it must have been youthful
impatience which had induced him thus to spur on sooner
than his attendants.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry," said the stranger, "to break in upon you
thus unseasonably&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here the Baron interrupted him with a world of compliments
and greetings; for, to tell the truth, he prided himself
upon his courtesy and his eloquence.  The stranger
attempted, once or twice, to stem the torrent of words, but in
vain; so he bowed his head and suffered it to flow on.  By
the time the Baron had come to a pause they had reached
the inner court of the castle; and the stranger was again
about to speak, when he was once more interrupted by the
appearance of the female part of the family, leading forth
the shrinking and blushing bride.  He gazed on her for a
moment as one entranced; it seemed as if his whole soul
beamed forth in the gaze, and rested upon that lovely form.
One of the maiden aunts whispered something in her ear;
she made an effort to speak; her moist blue eye was timidly
raised, gave a shy glance of inquiry on the stranger, and was
cast again to the ground.  The words died away; but there
was a sweet smile playing about her lips, and a soft dimpling
of the cheek, that showed her glance had not been
unsatisfactory.  It was impossible for a girl of the fond age of
eighteen, highly predisposed for love and matrimony, not
to be pleased with so gallant a cavalier.
</p>

<p>
The late hour at which the guest had arrived left no time
for parley.  The Baron was peremptory, and deferred all
particular conversation until the morning, and led the way
to the untasted banquet.
</p>

<p>
It was served up in the great hall of the castle.  Around
the walls hung the hard-favored portraits of the heroes of the
house of Katzenellenbogen, and the trophies which they had
gained in the field and in the chase.  Hacked corselets,
splintered jousting spears, and tattered banners, were mingled
with the spoils of sylvan warfare: the jaws of the wolf, and
the tusks of the boar, grinned horribly among crossbows and
battle-axes, and a huge pair of antlers branched immediately
over the head of the youthful bridegroom.
</p>

<p>
The cavalier took but little notice of the company or the
entertainment.  He scarcely tasted the banquet, but seemed
absorbed in admiration of his bride.  He conversed in a low
tone, that could not be overheard&mdash;for the language of love
is never loud; but where is the female ear so dull that it
can not catch the softest whisper of the lover?  There was a
mingled tenderness and gravity in his manner that appeared
to have a powerful effect upon the young lady.  Her color
came and went, as she listened with deep attention.  Now and
then she made some blushing reply, and when his eye was
turned away she would steal a sidelong glance at his romantic
countenance, and heave a gentle sigh of tender happiness.
It was evident that the young couple were completely
enamored.  The aunts, who were deeply versed in the mysteries
of the heart, declared that they had fallen in love with each
other at first sight.
</p>

<p>
The feast went on merrily, or at least noisily, for the
guests were all blessed with those keen appetites that attend
upon light purses and mountain air.  The Baron told his best
and longest stories, and never had he told them so well, or
with such great effect.  If there was anything marvelous,
his auditors were lost in astonishment; and if anything
facetious, they were sure to laugh exactly in the right place.
The Baron, it is true, like most great men, was too dignified
to utter any joke but a dull one: it was always enforced,
however, by a bumper of excellent Hoch-heimer; and even a
dull joke, at one's own table, served up with jolly old wine,
is irresistible.  Many good things were said by poorer and
keener wits that would not bear repeating, except on similar
occasions; many sly speeches whispered in ladies' ears that
almost convulsed them with suppressed laughter; and a song
or two roared out by a poor, but merry and broad-faced
cousin of the Baron, that absolutely made the maiden aunts
hold up their fans.
</p>

<p>
Amid all this revelry, the stranger-guest maintained a
most singular and unseasonable gravity.  His countenance
assumed a deeper cast of dejection as the evening advanced,
and, strange as it may appear, even the Baron's jokes seemed
only to render him the more melancholy.  At times he was
lost in thought, and at times there was a perturbed and
restless wandering of the eye that bespoke a mind but ill at ease.
His conversation with the bride became more and more earnest
and mysterious.  Lowering clouds began to steal over
the fair serenity of her brow, and tremors to run through her
tender frame.
</p>

<p>
All this could not escape the notice of the company.
Their gaiety was chilled by the unaccountable gloom of
the bridegroom; their spirits were infected; whispers and
glances were interchanged, accompanied by shrugs and
dubious shakes of the head.  The song and the laugh grew
less and less frequent: there were dreary pauses in the
conversation, which were at length succeeded by wild tales, and
supernatural legends.  One dismal story produced another
still more dismal, and the Baron nearly frightened some of
the ladies into hysterics with the history of the goblin
horseman that carried away the fair Leonora&mdash;a dreadful, but true
story, which has since been put into excellent verse, and is
read and believed by all the world.
</p>

<p>
The bridegroom listened to this tale with profound attention.
He kept his eyes steadily fixed on the Baron, and, as
the story drew to a close, began gradually to rise from his
seat, growing taller and taller, until, in the Baron's
entranced eye, he seemed almost to tower into a giant.  The
moment the tale was finished, he heaved a deep sigh, and
took a solemn farewell of the company.  They were all
amazement.  The Baron was perfectly thunderstruck.
</p>

<p>
"What! going to leave the castle at midnight?  Why,
everything was prepared for his reception; a chamber was
ready for him if he wished to retire."
</p>

<p>
The stranger shook his head mournfully and mysteriously:
"I must lay my head in a different chamber to-night!"
</p>

<p>
There was something in this reply, and the tone in which
it was uttered, that made the Baron's heart misgive him;
but he rallied his forces, and repeated his hospitable
entreaties.  The stranger shook his head silently, but positively,
at every offer; and, waving his farewell to the company,
stalked slowly out of the hall.  The maiden aunts were absolutely
petrified&mdash;the bride hung her head, and a tear stole to
her eye.
</p>

<p>
The Baron followed the stranger to the great court of the
castle, where the black charger stood pawing the earth and
snorting with impatience.  When they had reached the portal,
whose deep archway was dimly lighted by a cresset, the
stranger paused, and addressed the Baron in a hollow tone
of voice, which the vaulted roof rendered still more
sepulchral.  "Now that we are alone," said he, "I will impart to
you the reason of my going.  I have a solemn, an indispensable
engagement&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why," said the Baron, "can not you send some one in
your place?"
</p>

<p>
"It admits of no substitute&mdash;I must attend it in person&mdash;I
must away to Wurtzburg cathedral&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ay," said the Baron, plucking up spirit, "but not until
to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow you shall take your bride there."
</p>

<p>
"No! no!" replied the stranger, with tenfold solemnity,
"my engagement is with no bride&mdash;the worms! the worms
expect me!  I am a dead man&mdash;I have been slain by robbers&mdash;my
body lies at Wurtzburg&mdash;at midnight I am to be buried&mdash;the
grave is waiting for me&mdash;I must keep my appointment!"
</p>

<p>
He sprang on his black charger, dashed over the drawbridge,
and the clattering of his horse's hoofs was lost in the
whistling of the night-blast.
</p>

<p>
The Baron returned to the hall in the utmost consternation,
and related what had passed.  Two ladies fainted outright;
others sickened at the idea of having banqueted with
a spectre.  It was the opinion of some that this might be the
wild huntsman famous in German legend.  Some talked of
mountain sprites, of wood-demons, and of other supernatural
beings, with which the good people of Germany have been
so grievously harassed since time immemorial.  One of the
poor relations ventured to suggest that it might be some
sportive evasion of the young cavalier, and that the very
gloominess of the caprice seemed to accord with so melancholy
a personage.  This, however, drew on him the indignation
of the whole company, and especially of the Baron,
who looked upon him as little better than an infidel; so that
he was fain to abjure his heresy as speedily as possible, and
come into the faith of the true believers.
</p>

<p>
But, whatever may have been the doubts entertained,
they were completely put to an end by the arrival, next
day, of regular missives confirming the intelligence of the
young Count's murder, and his interment in Wurtzburg
cathedral.
</p>

<p>
The dismay at the castle may well be imagined.  The
Baron shut himself up in his chamber.  The guests who had
come to rejoice with him could not think of abandoning him
in his distress.  They wandered about the courts, or collected
in groups in the hall, shaking their heads and shrugging
their shoulders at the troubles of so good a man; and sat
longer than ever at table, and ate and drank more stoutly
than ever, by way of keeping up their spirits.  But the
situation of the widowed bride was the most pitiable.  To have
lost a husband before she had even embraced him&mdash;and such
a husband! if the very spectre could be so gracious and noble,
what must have been the living man?  She filled the house
with lamentations.
</p>

<p>
On the night of the second day of her widowhood, she
had retired to her chamber, accompanied by one of her aunts,
who insisted on sleeping with her.  The aunt, who was one
of the best tellers of ghost stories in all Germany, had just
been recounting one of her longest, and had fallen asleep in
the very midst of it.  The chamber was remote, and overlooked
a small garden.  The niece lay pensively gazing at the
beams of the rising moon, as they trembled on the leaves of
an aspen tree before the lattice.  The castle clock had just
tolled midnight, when a soft strain of music stole up from the
garden.  She rose hastily from her bed and stepped lightly
to the window.  A tall figure stood among the shadows of
the trees.  As it raised its head, a beam of moonlight fell
upon the countenance.  Heaven and earth! she beheld the
Spectre Bridegroom!  A loud shriek at that moment burst
upon her ear, and her aunt, who had been awakened by the
music, and had followed her silently to the window, fell into
her arms.  When she looked again, the spectre had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Of the two females, the aunt now required the most soothing,
for she was perfectly beside herself with terror.  As to
the young lady, there was something, even in the spectre of
her lover, that seemed endearing.  There was still the
semblance of manly beauty; and though the shadow of a man is
but little calculated to satisfy the affections of a love-sick
girl, yet, where the substance is not to be had, even that is
consoling.  The aunt declared she would never sleep in that
chamber again; the niece, for once, was refractory, and
declared as strongly that she would sleep in no other in the
castle: the consequence was that she had to sleep in it alone;
but she drew a promise from her aunt not to relate the story
of the spectre, lest she should be denied the only melancholy
pleasure left her on earth&mdash;that of inhabiting the chamber
over which the guardian shade of her lover kept its nightly
vigils.
</p>

<p>
How long the good old lady would have observed this
promise is uncertain, for she dearly loved to talk of the
marvelous, and there is a triumph in being the first to tell a
frightful story; it is, however, still quoted in the
neighborhood, as a memorable instance of female secrecy, that she
kept it to herself for a whole week; when she was suddenly
absolved from all further restraint by intelligence brought to
the breakfast-table one morning that the young lady was
not to be found.  Her room was empty&mdash;the bed had not
been slept in&mdash;the window was open&mdash;and the bird had
flown!
</p>

<p>
The astonishment and concern with which the intelligence
was received can only be imagined by those who have witnessed
the agitation which the mishaps of a great man cause
among his friends.  Even the poor relations paused for a
moment from the indefatigable labors of the trencher; when
the aunt, who had at first been struck speechless, wrung her
hands and shrieked out, "The goblin! the goblin!  She's
carried away by the goblin!"
</p>

<p>
In a few words she related the fearful scene of the garden,
and concluded that the spectre must have carried off his bride.
Two of the domestics corroborated the opinion, for they had
heard the clattering of a horse's hoofs down the mountain
about midnight, and had no doubt that it was the spectre on
his black charger, bearing her away to the tomb.  All present
were struck with the direful probability; for events of the
kind are extremely common in Germany, as many
well-authenticated histories bear witness.
</p>

<p>
What a lamentable situation was that of the poor Baron!
What a heartrending dilemma for a fond father, and a
member of the great family of Katzenellenbogen!  His only
daughter had either been rapt away to the grave, or he was
to have some wood-demon for a son-in-law, and, perchance,
a troop of goblin grandchildren.  As usual, he was completely
bewildered, and all the castle in an uproar.  The men
were ordered to take horse and scour every road and path
and glen of the Odenwald.  The Baron himself had just
drawn on his jack-boots, girded on his sword, and was about
to mount his steed to sally forth on the doubtful quest, when
he was brought to a pause by a new apparition.  A lady was
seen approaching the castle, mounted on a palfrey attended
by a cavalier on horseback.  She galloped up to the gate,
sprang from her horse, and falling at the Baron's feet,
embraced his knees.  It was his lost daughter, and her
companion&mdash;the Spectre Bridegroom!  The Baron was astounded.
He looked at his daughter, then at the spectre, and almost
doubted the evidence of his senses.  The latter, too, was
wonderfully improved in his appearance, since his visit to the
world of spirits.  His dress was splendid, and set off a noble
figure of manly symmetry.  He was no longer pale and
melancholy.  His fine countenance was flushed with the glow of
youth, and joy rioted in his large dark eye.
</p>

<p>
The mystery was soon cleared up.  The cavalier (for, in
truth, as you must have known all the while, he was no
goblin) announced himself as Sir Herman Von Starkenfaust.
He related his adventure with the young Count.  He told
how he had hastened to the castle to deliver the unwelcome
tidings, but that the eloquence of the Baron had interrupted
him in every attempt to tell his tale.  How the sight of the
bride had completely captivated him, and that to pass a few
hours near her he had tacitly suffered the mistake to
continue.  How he had been sorely perplexed in what way to
make a decent retreat, until the Baron's goblin stories had
suggested his eccentric exit.  How, fearing the feudal hostility
of the family, he had repeated his visits by stealth&mdash;had
haunted the garden beneath the young lady's window&mdash;had
wooed&mdash;had won&mdash;had borne away in triumph&mdash;and, in a
word, had wedded the fair.
</p>

<p>
Under any other circumstances the Baron would have been
inflexible, for he was tenacious of paternal authority and
devoutly obstinate in all family feuds; but he loved his daughter;
he had lamented her as lost; he rejoiced to find her still
alive; and, though her husband was of a hostile house, yet,
thank Heaven, he was not a goblin.  There was something, it
must be acknowledged, that did not exactly accord with his
notions of strict veracity, in the joke the knight had passed
upon him of his being a dead man; but several old friends
present, who had served in the wars, assured him that every
stratagem was excusable in love, and that the cavalier was
entitled to especial privilege, having lately served as a
trooper.
</p>

<p>
Matters, therefore, were happily arranged.  The Baron
pardoned the young couple on the spot.  The revels at the
castle were resumed.  The poor relations overwhelmed this
new member of the family with loving-kindness; he was so
gallant, so generous&mdash;and so rich.  The aunts, it is true, were
somewhat scandalized that their system of strict seclusion,
and passive obedience, should be so badly exemplified, but
attributed it all to their negligence in not having the windows
grated.  One of them was particularly mortified at having
her marvelous story marred, and that the only spectre she had
ever seen should turn out a counterfeit; but the niece seemed
perfectly happy at having found him substantial flesh and
blood&mdash;and so the story ends.

<i>Emile Erckmann (born 1822, died 1899)

charming novels and plays which attained
a great vogue.  These, appearing under the

THE MYSTERIOUS SKETCH
</p>

<p class="t3">
By ERCKMANN&mdash;CHATRIAN
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3b">
I
</p>

<p>
Opposite the chapel of Saint Sebalt in Nuremberg,
at the corner of Trabaus Street, there stands a little
tavern, tall and narrow, with a toothed gable and
dusty windows, whose roof is surmounted by a
plaster Virgin.  It was there that I spent the unhappiest
days of my life.  I had gone to Nuremberg to study the old
German masters; but in default of ready money, I had to
paint portraits&mdash;and such portraits!  Fat old women with
their cats on their laps, big-wigged aldermen, burgomasters
in three-cornered hats&mdash;all horribly bright with ochre and
vermilion.  From portraits I descended to sketches, and from
sketches to silhouettes.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is more annoying than to have your landlord
come to you every day with pinched lips, shrill voice, and
impudent manner to say: "Well, sir, how soon are you going to
pay me?  Do you know how much your bill is?  No; that
doesn't worry you!  You eat, drink, and sleep calmly enough.
God feeds the sparrows.  Your bill now amounts to two hundred
florins and ten kreutzers&mdash;it is not worth talking about."
</p>

<p>
Those who have not heard any one talk in this way can
form no idea of it; love of art, imagination, and the sacred
enthusiasm for the beautiful are blasted by the breath of such
an attack.  You become awkward and timid; all your energy
evaporates, as well as your feeling of personal dignity, and
you bow respectfully at a distance to the burgomaster
Schneegans.
</p>

<p>
One night, not having a sou, as usual, and threatened with
imprisonment by this worthy Mister Rap, I determined to
make him a bankrupt by cutting my throat.  Seated on my
narrow bed, opposite the window, in this agreeable mood,
I gave myself up to a thousand philosophical reflections, more
or less comforting.
</p>

<p>
"What is man?" I asked myself.  "An omnivorous animal;
his jaws, provided with canines, incisors, and molars, prove
it.  The canines are made to tear meat; the incisors to bite
fruits; and the molars to masticate, grind and triturate animal
and vegetable substances that are pleasant to smell and to
taste.  But when he has nothing to masticate, this being is
an absurdity in Nature, a superfluity, a fifth wheel to the
coach."
</p>

<p>
Such were my reflections.  I dared not open my razor for
fear that the invincible force of my logic would inspire me
with the courage to make an end of it all.  After having
argued so finely, I blew out my candle, postponing the sequel
till the morrow.
</p>

<p>
That abominable Rap had completely stupefied me.  I
could do nothing but silhouettes, and my sole desire was to
have some money to rid myself of his odious presence.  But
on this night a singular change came over my mind.  I awoke
about one o'clock&mdash;I lit my lamp, and, enveloping myself in
my gray gabardine, I drew upon the paper a rapid sketch
after the Dutch school&mdash;something strange and bizarre, which
had not the slightest resemblance to my ordinary conceptions.
</p>

<p>
Imagine a dreary courtyard enclosed by high dilapidated
walls.  These walls are furnished with hooks, seven or eight
feet from the ground.  You see, at a glance, that it is a
butchery.
</p>

<p>
On the left, there extends a lattice structure; you
perceive through it a quartered beef suspended from the roof
by enormous pulleys.  Great pools of blood run over the
flagstones and unite in a ditch full of refuse.
</p>

<p>
The light falls from above, between the chimneys where
the weathercocks stand out from a bit of the sky the size
of your hand, and the roofs of the neighboring houses throw
bold shadows from story to story.
</p>

<p>
At the back of this place is a shed, beneath the shed a
pile of wood, and upon the pile of wood some ladders, a few
bundles of straw, some coils of rope, a chicken-coop, and an
old dilapidated rabbit-hutch.
</p>

<p>
How did these heterogeneous details suggest themselves
to my imagination?  I don't know; I had no reminiscences,
and yet every stroke of the pencil seemed the result of
observation, and strange because it was all so true.  Nothing was
lacking.
</p>

<p>
But on the right, one corner of the sketch remained a
blank.  I did not know what to put there....  Something
suddenly seemed to writhe there, to move!  Then I saw a
foot, the sole of a foot.  Notwithstanding this improbable
position, I followed my inspiration without reference to my
own criticism.  This foot was joined to a leg&mdash;over this leg,
stretched out with effort, there soon floated the skirt of a
dress.  In short, there appeared by degrees, an old woman,
pale, disheveled, and wasted, thrown down at the side of a
well, and struggling to free herself from a hand that clutched
at her throat.
</p>

<p>
It was a murder scene that I was drawing.  The pencil
fell from my hand.
</p>

<p>
This woman, in the boldest attitude, with her thighs bent
on the curb of the well, her face contracted by terror, and
her two hands grasping the murderer's arm, frightened me.
I could not look at her.  But the man&mdash;he, the person to
whom that arm belonged&mdash;I could not see him.  It was
impossible for me to finish the sketch.
</p>

<p>
"I am tired," I said, my forehead dripping with perspiration;
"there is only this figure to do; I will finish it to-morrow.
It will be easy then."
</p>

<p>
And I went to bed again, thoroughly frightened by my
vision.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, I got up very early.  I was dressing
in order to resume my interrupted work, when two little
knocks were heard on my door.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!"
</p>

<p>
The door opened.  An old man, tall, thin, and dressed in
black, appeared on the threshold.  This man's face, his eyes
set close together and his large nose like the beak of an
eagle, surmounted by a high bony forehead, had something
severe about it.  He bowed to me gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Mister Christian Vénius, the painter?" said he.
</p>

<p>
"That is my name, sir."
</p>

<p>
He bowed again, adding:
</p>

<p>
"The Baron Frederick Van Spreckdal."
</p>

<p>
The appearance of the rich amateur, Van Spreckdal, judge
of the criminal court, in my poor lodging, greatly disturbed
me.  I could not help throwing a stealthy glance at my old
worm-eaten furniture, my damp hangings and my dusty floor.
I felt humiliated by such dilapidation; but Van Spreckdal did
not seem to take any account of these details; and sitting
down at my little table:
</p>

<p>
"Mister Vénius," he resumed, "I come&mdash;"  But at this
instant his glance fell upon the unfinished sketch&mdash;he did
not finish his phrase.
</p>

<p>
I was sitting on the edge of my little bed; and the sudden
attention that this personage bestowed upon one of my
productions made my heart beat with an indefinable apprehension.
</p>

<p>
At the end of a minute, Van Spreckdal lifted his head:
</p>

<p>
"Are you the author of that sketch?" he asked me with an
intent look.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What is the price of it?"
</p>

<p>
"I never sell my sketches.  It is the plan for a picture."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said he, picking up the paper with the tips of his
long yellow fingers.
</p>

<p>
He took a lens from his waistcoat pocket and began to
study the design in silence.
</p>

<p>
The sun was now shining obliquely into the garret.  Van
Spreckdal never said a word; the hook of his immense nose
increased, his heavy eyebrows contracted, and his long
pointed chin took a turn upward, making a thousand little
wrinkles in his long, thin cheeks.  The silence was so
profound that I could distinctly hear the plaintive buzzing of a
fly that had been caught in a spider's web.
</p>

<p>
"And the dimensions of this picture, Mister Vénius," he
said without looking at me.
</p>

<p>
"Three feet by four."
</p>

<p>
"The price?"
</p>

<p>
"Fifty ducats."
</p>

<p>
Van Spreckdal laid the sketch on the table, and drew from
his pocket a large purse of green silk shaped like a pear;
he drew the rings of it&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Fifty ducats," said he, "here they are."
</p>

<p>
I was simply dazzled.
</p>

<p>
The Baron rose and bowed to me, and I heard his big
ivory-headed cane resounding on each step until he reached
the bottom of the stairs.  Then, recovering from my stupor,
I suddenly remembered that I had not thanked him, and I
flew down the five flights like lightning; but when I reached
the bottom, I looked to the right and left; the street was
deserted.
</p>

<p>
"Well!" I said, "this is strange."
</p>

<p>
And I went upstairs again all out of breath.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3b">
II
</p>

<p>
The surprising way in which Van Spreckdal had appeared
to me threw me into a deep wonderment.  "Yesterday," I said
to myself, as I contemplated the pile of ducats glittering in
the sun, "yesterday I formed the wicked intention of cutting
my throat, all for the want of a few miserable florins, and now
to-day Fortune has showered them from the clouds.  Indeed
it was fortunate that I did not open my razor; and, if the
same temptation ever comes to me again, I will take care to
wait until the morrow."
</p>

<p>
After making these judicious reflections, I sat down to
finish the sketch; four strokes of the pencil and it would be
finished.  But here an incomprehensible difficulty awaited me.
It was impossible for me to make those four sweeps of the
pencil; I had lost the thread of my inspiration, and the
mysterious personage no longer stood out in my brain.  I tried
in vain to evoke him, to sketch him, and to recover him;
he no longer accorded with the surroundings than with a
figure by Raphael in a Teniers inn-kitchen.  I broke out into
a profuse perspiration.
</p>

<p>
At this moment, Rap opened the door without knocking,
according to his praiseworthy custom.  His eyes fell upon my
pile of ducats and in a shrill voice he cried:
</p>

<p>
"Eh! eh! so I catch you.  Will you still persist in telling
me, Mr. Painter, that you have no money?"
</p>

<p>
And his hooked fingers advanced with that nervous trembling
that the sight of gold always produces in a miser.
</p>

<p>
For a few seconds I was stupefied.
</p>

<p>
The memory of all the indignities that this individual had
inflicted upon me, his covetous look, and his impudent smile
exasperated me.  With a single bound, I caught hold of him,
and pushed him out of the room, slamming the door in his
face.
</p>

<p>
This was done with the crack and rapidity of a spring
snuff-box.
</p>

<p>
But from outside the old usurer screamed like an eagle:
</p>

<p>
"My money, you thief, my money!"
</p>

<p>
The lodgers come out of their rooms, asking:
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?  What has happened?"
</p>

<p>
I opened the door suddenly and quickly gave Mister Rap
a kick in the spine that sent him rolling down more than
twenty steps.
</p>

<p>
"That's what's the matter!" I cried, quite beside myself.
Then I shut the door and bolted it, while bursts of laughter
from the neighbors greeted Mister Rap in the passage.
</p>

<p>
I was satisfied with myself; I rubbed my hands together.
This adventure had put new life into me; I resumed my work,
and was about to finish the sketch when I heard an unusual
noise.
</p>

<p>
Butts of muskets were grounded on the pavement.  I
looked out of my window and saw three soldiers in full
uniform with grounded arms in front of my door.
</p>

<p>
I said to myself in my terror: "Can it be that that
scoundrel of a Rap has had any bones broken?"
</p>

<p>
And here is the strange peculiarity of the human mind: I,
who the night before had wanted to cut my own throat, shook
from head to foot, thinking that I might well be hanged if
Rap were dead.
</p>

<p>
The stairway was filled with confused noises.  It was an
ascending flood of heavy footsteps, clanking arms, and short
syllables.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly somebody tried to open my door.  It was shut.
</p>

<p>
Then there was a general clamor.
</p>

<p>
"In the name of the law&mdash;open!"
</p>

<p>
I arose, trembling and weak in the knees.
</p>

<p>
"Open!" the same voice repeated.
</p>

<p>
I thought to escape over the roofs; but I had hardly put
my head out of the little snuff-box window, when I drew
back, seized with vertigo.  I saw in a flash all the windows
below with their shining panes, their flower-pots, their
birdcages, and their gratings.  Lower, the balcony; still lower,
the street lamp; still lower again, the sign of the "Red Cask"
framed in iron-work; and, finally, three glittering bayonets,
only awaiting my fall to run me through the body from the
sole of my foot to the crown of my head.  On the roof of the
opposite house a tortoise-shell cat was crouching behind a
chimney, watching a band of sparrows fighting and scolding
in the gutter.
</p>

<p>
One can not imagine to what clearness, intensity, and
rapidity the human eye acquires when stimulated by fear.
</p>

<p>
At the third summons I heard:
</p>

<p>
"Open, or we shall force it!"
</p>

<p>
Seeing that flight was impossible, I staggered to the door
and drew the bolt.
</p>

<p>
Two hands immediately fell upon my collar.  A dumpy,
little man, smelling of wine, said:
</p>

<p>
"I arrest you!"
</p>

<p>
He wore a bottle-green redingote, buttoned to the chin,
and a stovepipe hat.  He had large brown whiskers, rings on
every finger, and was named Passauf.
</p>

<p>
He was the chief of police.
</p>

<p>
Five bull-dogs with flat caps, noses like pistols, and lower
jaws turning upward, observed me from outside.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" I asked Passauf.
</p>

<p>
"Come downstairs," he cried roughly, as he gave a sign
to one of his men to seize me.
</p>

<p>
This man took hold of me, more dead than alive, while
several other men turned my room upside down.
</p>

<p>
I went downstairs supported by the arms like a person in
the last stages of consumption&mdash;with hair disheveled and
stumbling at every step.
</p>

<p>
They thrust me into a cab between two strong fellows,
who charitably let me see the ends of their clubs, held to
their wrists by a leather string&mdash;and then the carriage
started off.
</p>

<p>
I heard behind us the feet of all the urchins of the town.
</p>

<p>
"What have I done?" I asked one of my keepers.
</p>

<p>
He looked at the other with a strange smile and said:
</p>

<p>
"Hans&mdash;he asks what he has done!"
</p>

<p>
That smile froze my blood.
</p>

<p>
Soon a deep shadow enveloped the carriage; the horses'
hoofs resounded under an archway.  We were entering the
Raspelhaus.  Of this place one might say:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Dans cet antre,<br>
  Je vois fort bien comme l'on entre,<br>
  Et ne vois point comme on en sort."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
All is not rose-colored in this world; from the claws of
Rap I fell into a dungeon, from which very few poor devils
have a chance to escape.
</p>

<p>
Large dark courtyards and rows of windows like a hospital,
and furnished with gratings; not a sprig of verdure, not
a festoon of ivy, not even a weathercock in perspective&mdash;such
was my new lodging.  It was enough to make one tear
his hair out by the roots.
</p>

<p>
The police officers, accompanied by the jailer, took me
temporarily to a lock-up.
</p>

<p>
The jailer, if I remember rightly, was named Kasper
Schlüssel; with his gray, woolen cap, his pipe between his
teeth, and his bunch of keys at his belt, he reminded me of
the Owl-God of the Caribs.  He had the same golden yellow
eyes, that see in the dark, a nose like a comma, and a neck
that was sunk between the shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Schlüssel shut me up as calmly as one locks up his socks
in a cupboard, while thinking of something else.  As for me,
I stood for more than ten minutes with my hands behind
my back and my head bowed.  At the end of that time I
made the following reflection: "When falling, Rap cried out,
'I am assassinated,' but he did not say by whom.  I will say
it was my neighbor, the old merchant with the spectacles: he
will be hanged in my place."
</p>

<p>
This idea comforted my heart, and I drew a long breath.
Then I looked about my prison.  It seemed to have been
newly whitewashed, and the walls were bare of designs, except
in one corner, where a gallows had been crudely sketched
by my predecessor.  The light was admitted through a
bull's-eye about nine or ten feet from the floor; the furniture
consisted of a bundle of straw and a tub.
</p>

<p>
I sat down upon the straw with my hands around my
knees in deep despondency.  It was with great difficulty that
I could think clearly; but suddenly imagining that Rap, before
dying, had denounced me, my legs began to tingle, and I
jumped up coughing, as if the hempen cord were already
tightening around my neck.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment, I heard Schlüssel walking down the
corridor; he opened the lock-up, and told me to follow him.
He was still accompanied by the two officers, so I fell into
step resolutely.
</p>

<p>
We walked down long galleries, lighted at intervals by
small windows from within.  Behind a grating I saw the
famous Jic-Jack, who was going to be executed on the
morrow.  He had on a straitjacket and sang out in a raucous
voice:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Je suis le roi de ces montagnes.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Seeing me, he called out:
</p>

<p>
"Eh! comrade!  I'll keep a place for you at my right."
</p>

<p>
The two police officers and the Owl-God looked at each
other and smiled, while I felt the goose-flesh creep down the
whole length of my back.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3b">
III
</p>

<p>
Schlüssel shoved me into a large and very dreary hall,
with benches arranged in a semicircle.  The appearance of
this deserted hall, with its two high grated windows, and its
Christ carved in old brown oak with His arms extended and
His head sorrowfully inclined upon His shoulder, inspired me
with I do not know what kind of religious fear that accorded
with my actual situation.
</p>

<p>
All my ideas of false accusation disappeared, and my lips
tremblingly murmured a prayer.
</p>

<p>
I had not prayed for a long time; but misfortune always
brings us to thoughts of submission.  Man is so little in
himself!
</p>

<p>
Opposite me, on an elevated seat, two men were sitting,
with their backs to the light, and consequently their faces
were in shadow.  However, I recognized Van Spreckdal by
his acquiline profile, illuminated by an oblique reflection from
the window.  The other person was fat, he had round, chubby
cheeks and short hands, and he wore a robe, like Van
Spreckdal.
</p>

<p>
Below was the clerk of the court, Conrad; he was writing
at a low table and was tickling the tip of his ear with the
feather-end of his pen.  When I entered, he stopped to look
at me curiously.
</p>

<p>
They made me sit down, and Van Spreckdal, raising his
voice, said to me:
</p>

<p>
"Christian Vénius, where did you get this sketch?"
</p>

<p>
He showed me the nocturnal sketch which was then in
his possession.  It was handed to me.  After having examined
it, I replied:
</p>

<p>
"I am the author of it."
</p>

<p>
A long silence followed; the clerk of the court, Conrad,
wrote down my reply.  I heard his pen scratch over the
paper, and I thought: "Why did they ask me that question?
That has nothing to do with the kick I gave Rap in the
back."
</p>

<p>
"You are the author of it?" asked Van Spreckdal.  "What
is the subject?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a subject of pure fancy."
</p>

<p>
"You have not copied the details from some spot?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; I imagined it all."
</p>

<p>
"Accused Christian," said the judge in a severe tone, "I
ask you to reflect.  Do not lie."
</p>

<p>
"I have spoken the truth."
</p>

<p>
"Write that down, clerk," said Van Spreckdal.
</p>

<p>
The pen scratched again.
</p>

<p>
"And this woman," continued the judge&mdash;"this woman
who is being murdered at the side of the well&mdash;did you
imagine her also?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
"You have never seen her?"
</p>

<p>
"Never."
</p>

<p>
Van Spreckdal rose indignantly; then, sitting down again,
he seemed to consult his companion in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
These two dark profiles silhouetted against the brightness
of the window, and the three men standing behind me, the
silence in the hall&mdash;everything made me shiver.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want with me?  What have I done?" I
murmured.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Van Spreckdal said to my guardians:
</p>

<p>
"You can take the prisoner back to the carriage; we will
go to Metzerstrasse."
</p>

<p>
Then, addressing me:
</p>

<p>
"Christian Vénius," he cried, "you are in a deplorable
situation.  Collect your thoughts and remember that if the law
of men is inflexible, there still remains for you the mercy of
God.  This you can merit by confessing your crime."
</p>

<p>
These words stunned me like a blow from a hammer.  I
fell back with extended arms, crying:
</p>

<p>
"Ah! what a terrible dream!"
</p>

<p>
And I fainted.
</p>

<p>
When I regained consciousness, the carriage was rolling
slowly down the street; another one preceded us.  The two
officers were always with me.  One of them on the way
offered a pinch of snuff to his companion; mechanically I
reached out my hand toward the snuff-box, but he withdrew it
quickly.
</p>

<p>
My cheeks reddened with shame, and I turned away my
head to conceal my emotion.
</p>

<p>
"If you look outside," said the man with the snuff-box,
"we shall be obliged to put handcuffs on you."
</p>

<p>
"May the devil strangle you, you infernal scoundrel!" I
said to myself.  And as the carriage now stopped, one of
them got out, while the other held me by the collar; then,
seeing that his comrade was ready to receive me, he pushed
me rudely to him.
</p>

<p>
These infinite precautions to hold possession of my
person boded no good; but I was far from predicting the
seriousness of the accusation that hung over my head until an
alarming circumstance opened my eyes and threw me into
despair.
</p>

<p>
They pushed me along a low alley, the pavement of which
was unequal and broken; along the wall there ran a yellowish
ooze, exhaling a fetid odor.  I walked down this dark place
with the two men behind me.  A little further there appeared
the chiaroscuro of an interior courtyard.
</p>

<p>
I grew more and more terror-stricken as I advanced.  It
was no natural feeling: it was a poignant anxiety, outside of
nature&mdash;like the nightmare.  I recoiled instinctively at each
step.
</p>

<p>
"Go on!" cried one of the policemen, laying his hand on
my shoulder; "go on!"
</p>

<p>
But what was my astonishment when, at the end of the
passage, I saw the courtyard that I had drawn the night
before, with its walls furnished with hooks, its rubbish-heap
of old iron, its chicken-coops, and its rabbit-hutch.  Not a
dormer window, high or low, not a broken pane, not the
slightest detail had been omitted.
</p>

<p>
I was thunderstruck by this strange revelation.
</p>

<p>
Near the well were the two judges, Van Spreckdal and
Richter.  At their feet lay the old woman extended on her
back, her long, thin, gray hair, her blue face, her eyes wide
open, and her tongue between her teeth.
</p>

<p>
It was a horrible spectacle!
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Van Spreckdal, with solemn accents, "what
have you to say?"
</p>

<p>
I did not reply.
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember having thrown this woman, Theresa
Becker, into this well, after having strangled her to rob her
of her money."
</p>

<p>
"No," I cried, "no!  I do not know this woman; I never
saw her before.  May God help me!"
</p>

<p>
"That will do," he replied in a dry voice.  And without
saying another word he went out with his companion.
</p>

<p>
The officers now believed they had best put handcuffs on
me.  They took me back to the Raspelhaus, in a state of
profound stupidity.  I did not know what to think; my
conscience itself troubled me; I even asked myself if I really
had murdered the old woman!
</p>

<p>
In the eyes of the officers I was condemned.
</p>

<p>
I will not tell you of my emotions that night in the
Raspelhaus, when, seated on my straw bed with the window
opposite me and the gallows in perspective, I heard the
watchmen cry in the silence of the night: "Sleep, people of
Nuremberg; the Lord watches over you.  One o'clock!  Two
o'clock!  Three o'clock!"
</p>

<p>
Every one may form his own idea of such a night.  There
is a fine saying that it is better to be hanged innocent than
guilty.  For the soul, yes; but for the body, it makes no difference;
on the contrary, it kicks, it curses its lot, it tries to
escape, knowing well enough that its rôle ends with the rope.
Add to this, that it repents not having sufficiently enjoyed
life and at having listened to the soul when it preached
abstinence.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! if I had only known!" it cried, "you would not have
led me about by a string with your big words, your beautiful
phrases, and your magnificent sentences!  You would not
have allured me with your fine promises.  I should have had
many happy moments that are now lost forever.  Everything
is over!  You said to me: 'Control your passions.'  Very well!
I did control them.  Here I am now! they are going to hang
me, and you&mdash;later they will speak of you as a sublime soul,
a stoical soul, a martyr to the errors of Justice.  They will
never think about me!"
</p>

<p>
Such were the sad reflections of my poor body.
</p>

<p>
Day broke; at first, dull and undecided, it threw an uncertain
light on my bull's-eye window with its cross-bars; then
it blazed against the wall at the back.  Outside the street
became lively.  This was a market-day; it was Friday.  I heard
the vegetable wagons pass and also the country people
with their baskets.  Some chickens cackled in their coops
in passing and some butter sellers chattered together.
The market opposite opened, and they began to arrange the
stalls.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it was broad daylight and the vast murmur of
the increasing crowd, housekeepers who assembled with
baskets on their arms, coming and going, discussing and
marketing, told me that it was eight o'clock.
</p>

<p>
With the light, my heart gained a little courage.  Some
of my black thoughts disappeared.  I desired to see what
was going on outside.
</p>

<p>
Other prisoners before me had managed to climb up to
the bull's-eye; they had dug some holes in the wall to mount
more easily.  I climbed in my turn, and, when seated in the
oval edge of the window, with my legs bent and my head
bowed, I could see the crowd, and all the life and movement.
Tears ran freely down my cheeks.  I thought no longer of
suicide&mdash;I experienced a need to live and breathe, which was
really extraordinary.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" I said, "to live what happiness!  Let them harness
me to a wheelbarrow&mdash;let them put a ball and chain around
my leg&mdash;nothing matters if I may only live!"
</p>

<p>
The old market, with its roof shaped like an extinguisher,
supported on heavy pillars, made a superb picture: old women
seated before their panniers of vegetables, their cages of
poultry and their baskets of eggs; behind them the Jews, dealers
in old clothes, their faces the color of old boxwood; butchers
with bare arms, cutting up meat on their stalls; countrymen,
with large hats on the backs of their heads, calm and grave
with their hands behind their backs and resting on their
sticks of hollywood, and tranquilly smoking their pipes.
Then the tumult and noise of the crowd&mdash;those screaming,
shrill, grave, high, and short words&mdash;those expressive
gestures&mdash;those sudden attitudes that show from a distance the
progress of a discussion and depict so well the character of
the individual&mdash;in short, all this captivated my mind, and
notwithstanding my sad condition, I felt happy to be still
of the world.
</p>

<p>
Now, while I looked about in this manner, a man&mdash;a
butcher&mdash;passed, inclining forward and carrying an enormous
quarter of beef on his shoulders; his arms were bare, his
elbows were raised upward and his head was bent under
them.  His long hair, like that of Salvator's Sicambrian, hid
his face from me; and yet, at the first glance, I trembled.
</p>

<p>
"It is he!" I said.
</p>

<p>
All the blood in my body rushed to my heart.  I got
down from the window trembling to the ends of my fingers,
feeling my cheeks quiver, and the pallor spread over my
face, stammering in a choked voice:
</p>

<p>
"It is he! he is there&mdash;there&mdash;and I, I have to die to
expiate his crime.  Oh, God! what shall I do?  What shall
I do?"
</p>

<p>
A sudden idea, an inspiration from Heaven, flashed across
my mind.  I put my hand in the pocket of my coat&mdash;my box
of crayons was there!
</p>

<p>
Then rushing to the wall, I began to trace the scene of the
murder with superhuman energy.  No uncertainty, no hesitation!
I knew the man!  I had seen him!  He was there before me!
</p>

<p>
At ten o'clock the jailer came to my cell.  His owl-like
impassibility gave place to admiration.
</p>

<p>
"Is it possible?" he cried, standing at the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"Go, bring me my judges," I said to him, pursuing my
work with an increasing exultation.
</p>

<p>
Schlüssel answered:
</p>

<p>
"They are waiting for you in the trial-room."
</p>

<p>
"I wish to make a revelation," I cried, as I put the
finishing touches to the mysterious personage.
</p>

<p>
He lived; he was frightful to see.  His full-faced figure,
foreshortened upon the wall, stood out from the white
background with an astonishing vitality.
</p>

<p>
The jailer went away.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes afterward the two judges appeared.  They
were stupefied.  I, trembling, with extended hand, said to
them:
</p>

<p>
"There is the murderer!"
</p>

<p>
After a few moments of silence, Van Spreckdal asked me:
</p>

<p>
"What is his name?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know; but he is at this moment in the market;
he is cutting up meat in the third stall to the left as you enter
from Trabaus Street."
</p>

<p>
"What do you think?" said he, leaning toward his colleague.
</p>

<p>
"Send for the man," he replied in a grave tone.
</p>

<p>
Several officers retained in the corridor obeyed this order.
The judges stood, examining the sketch.  As for me, I had
dropped on my bed of straw, my head between my knees,
perfectly exhausted.
</p>

<p>
Soon steps were heard echoing under the archway.  Those
who have never awaited the hour of deliverance and counted
the minutes, which seem like centuries&mdash;those who have
never experienced the sharp emotions of outrage, terror,
hope, and doubt&mdash;can have no conception of the inward chills
that I experienced at that moment.  I should have
distinguished the step of the murderer, walking between the
guards, among a thousand others.  They approached.  The
judges themselves seemed moved.  I raised up my head, my
heart feeling as if an iron hand had clutched it, and I fixed
my eyes upon the closed door.  It opened.  The man entered.
His cheeks were red and swollen, the muscles in his large
contracted jaws twitched as far as his ears, and his little
restless eyes, yellow like a wolf's, gleamed beneath his heavy
yellowish red eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
Van Spreckdal showed him the sketch in silence.
</p>

<p>
Then that murderous man, with the large shoulders, having
looked, grew pale&mdash;then, giving a roar which thrilled us
all with terror, he waved his enormous arms, and jumped
backward to overthrow the guards.  There was a terrible
struggle in the corridor; you could hear nothing but the
panting breathing of the butcher, his muttered imprecations,
and the short words and the shuffling feet of the guard, upon
the flagstones.
</p>

<p>
This lasted only about a minute.
</p>

<p>
Finally the assassin reentered, with his head hanging
down, his eyes bloodshot, and his hands fastened behind his
back.  He looked again at the picture of the murder; he
seemed to reflect, and then, in a low voice, as if talking to
himself:
</p>

<p>
"Who could have seen me," he said, "at midnight?"
</p>

<p>
I was saved!
</p>

<p class="thought">
. . . . . . . . . . . .
</p>

<p>
Many years have passed since that terrible adventure.
Thank Heaven!  I make silhouettes no longer, nor portraits
of burgomasters.  Through hard work and perseverance, I
have conquered my place in the world, and I earn my living
honorably by painting works of art&mdash;the sole end, in my
opinion, to which a true artist should aspire.  But the
memory of that nocturnal sketch has always remained in my
mind.  Sometimes, in the midst of work, the thought of it
recurs.  Then I lay down my palette and dream for hours.
</p>

<p>
How could a crime committed by a man that I did not
know&mdash;at a place that I had never seen&mdash;have been
reproduced by my pencil, in all its smallest details?
</p>

<p>
Was it chance?  No!  And moreover, what is chance but
the effect of a cause of which we are ignorant?
</p>

<p>
Was Schiller right when he said: "The immortal soul does
not participate in the weaknesses of matter; during the sleep
of the body, it spreads its radiant wings and travels, God
knows where!  What it then does, no one can say, but
inspiration sometimes betrays the secret of its nocturnal
wanderings."
</p>

<p>
Who knows?  Nature is more audacious in her realities
than man in his most fantastic imaginings.

MR. HIGGINBOTHAM'S CATASTROPHE
</p>

<p class="t3">
By NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE
</p>

<p>
A young fellow, a tobacco-pedler by trade, was on
his way from Morristown, where he had dealt
largely with the Deacon of the Shaker settlement,
to the village of Parker's Falls, on Salmon River.
He had a neat little cart, painted green, with a box of cigars
depicted on each side-panel, and an Indian chief, holding a
pipe and a golden tobacco-stalk, on the rear.  The pedler
drove a smart little mare, and was a young man of excellent
character, keen at a bargain, but none the worse liked by the
Yankees; who, as I have heard them say, would rather be
shaved with a sharp razor than a dull one.  Especially was
he beloved by the pretty girls along the Connecticut, whose
favor he used to court by presents of the best smoking
tobacco in his stock; knowing well that the country lasses of
New England are generally great performers on pipes.
Moreover, as will be seen in the course of my story, the pedler
was inquisitive, and something of a tattler, always itching
to hear the news, and anxious to tell it again.
</p>

<p>
After an early breakfast at Morristown, the tobacco-pedler,
whose name was Dominicus Pike, had traveled seven
miles through a solitary piece of woods, without speaking a
word to anybody but himself and his little gray mare.  It
being nearly seven o'clock, he was as eager to hold a
morning gossip as a city shopkeeper to read the morning paper.
An opportunity seemed at hand, when, after lighting a cigar
with a sun-glass, he looked up and perceived a man coming
over the brow of the hill, at the foot of which the pedler
had stopped his green cart.  Dominicus watched him as he
descended, and noticed that he carried a bundle over his
shoulder on the end of a stick, and traveled with a weary,
yet determined pace.  He did not look as if he had started
in the freshness of the morning, but had footed it all night,
and meant to do the same all day.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, mister," said Dominicus, when within
speaking distance.  "You go a pretty good jog.  What's the
latest news at Parker's Falls?"
</p>

<p>
The man pulled the broad brim of a gray hat over his
eyes, and answered, rather sullenly, that he did not come
from Parker's Falls, which, as being the limit of his own
day's journey, the pedler had naturally mentioned in his
inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then," rejoined Dominicus Pike, "let's have the
latest news where you did come from.  I'm not particular
about Parker's Falls.  Any place will answer."
</p>

<p>
Being thus importuned, the traveler&mdash;who was as ill-looking
a fellow as one would desire to meet, in a solitary piece
of woods&mdash;appeared to hesitate a little, as if he was either
searching his memory for news or weighing the expediency
of telling it.  At last, mounting on the step of the cart,
he whispered in the ear of Dominicus, though he might
have shouted aloud and no other mortal would have heard
him.
</p>

<p>
"I do remember one little trifle of news," said he.  "Old
Mr. Higginbotham, of Kimballton, was murdered in his
orchard, at eight o'clock last night, by an Irishman and a
nigger.  They strung him up to the branch of a St. Michael's
pear-tree, where nobody would find him till the morning."
</p>

<p>
As soon as this horrible intelligence was communicated
the stranger betook himself to his journey again, with more
speed than ever, not even turning his head when Dominicus
invited him to smoke a Spanish cigar and relate all the
particulars.  The pedler whistled to his mare and went up the
hill, pondering on the doleful fate of Mr. Higginbotham,
whom he had known in the way of trade, having sold him
many a bunch of long nines, and a great deal of pigtail,
lady's twist, and fig tobacco.  He was rather astonished at
the rapidity with which the news had spread.  Kimballton
was nearly sixty miles distant in a straight line; the murder
had been perpetrated only at eight o'clock the preceding
night; yet Dominicus had heard of it at seven in the morning,
when, in all probability, poor Mr. Higginbotham'a own
family had but just discovered his corpse, hanging on the
St. Michael's pear-tree.  The stranger on foot must have worn
seven-league boots, to travel at such a rate.
</p>

<p>
"Ill news flies fast, they say," thought Dominicus Pike;
"but this beats railroads.  The fellow ought to be hired to
go express with the President's Message."
</p>

<p>
The difficulty was solved by supposing that the narrator
had made a mistake of one day in the date of the occurrence;
so that our friend did not hesitate to introduce the
story at every tavern and country store along the road,
expending a whole bunch of Spanish wrappers among at least
twenty horrified audiences.  He found himself invariably the
first bearer of the intelligence, and was so pestered with
questions that he could not avoid filling up the outline, till it
became quite a respectable narrative.  He met with one piece
of corroborative evidence.  Mr. Higginbotham was a trader;
and a former clerk of his, to whom Dominicus related the
facts, testified that the old gentleman was accustomed to
return home through the orchard, about nightfall, with the
money and valuable papers of the store in his pocket.  The
clerk manifested but little grief at Mr. Higginbotham's
catastrophe, hinting, what the pedler had discovered in his own
dealings with him, that he was a crusty old fellow, as close
as a vise.  His property would descend to a pretty niece who
was now keeping school in Kimballton.
</p>

<p>
What with telling the news for the public good, and driving
bargains for his own, Dominicus was so much delayed on
the road that he chose to put up at a tavern, about five miles
short of Parker's Falls.  After supper, lighting one of his
prime cigars, he seated himself in the barroom, and went
through the story of the murder, which had grown so fast
that it took him a half hour to tell.  There were as many as
twenty people in the room, nineteen of whom received it all
for gospel.  But the twentieth was an elderly farmer, who had
arrived on horseback a short time before, and was now seated
in a corner smoking his pipe.  When the story was concluded,
he rose up very deliberately, brought his chair right
in front of Dominicus, and stared him full in the face,
puffing out the vilest tobacco smoke the pedler had ever
smelled.
</p>

<p>
"Will you make affidavit," demanded he in the tone of
a country justice taking an examination, "that old Squire
Higginbotham of Kimballton was murdered in his orchard
the night before last, and found hanging on his great
pear-tree yesterday morning?"
</p>

<p>
"I tell the story as I heard it, mister," answered Dominicus,
dropping his half-burned cigar; "I don't say that I saw
the thing done.  So I can't take my oath that he was
murdered exactly in that way."
</p>

<p>
"But I can take mine," said the farmer, "that if Squire
Higginbotham was murdered night before last, I drank a
glass of bitters with his ghost this morning.  Being a neighbor
of mine, he called me into his store, as I was riding by,
and treated me, and then asked me to do a little business for
him on the road.  He didn't seem to know any more about
his own murder than I did."
</p>

<p>
"Why, then, it can't be a fact!" exclaimed Dominicus Pike.
</p>

<p>
"I guess he'd have mentioned it, if it was," said the old
farmer; and he removed his chair back to the corner, leaving
Dominicus quite down in the mouth.
</p>

<p>
Here was a sad resurrection of old Mr. Higginbotham!
The pedler had no heart to mingle in the conversation any
more, but comforted himself with a glass of gin and water,
and went to bed, where, all night long, he dreamed of hanging
on the St. Michael's pear-tree.  To avoid the old farmer
(whom he so detested that his suspension would have pleased
him better than Mr. Higginbotham's), Dominicus rose in the
gray of the morning, put the little mare into the green cart,
and trotted swiftly away toward Parker's Falls.  The fresh
breeze, the dewy road, and the pleasant summer dawn revived
his spirits, and might have encouraged him to repeat
the old story had there been anybody awake to hear it.  But
he met neither ox-team, light wagon, chaise, horseman, nor
foot-traveler, till, just as he crossed Salmon River, a man
came trudging down to the bridge with a bundle over his
shoulder, on the end of a stick.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, mister," said the pedler, reining in his
mare.  "If you come from Kimballton or that neighborhood
maybe you can tell me the real fact about this affair of old
Mr. Higginbotham.  Was the old fellow actually murdered,
two or three nights ago, by an Irishman and a nigger?"
</p>

<p>
Dominicus had spoken in too great a hurry to observe,
at first, that the stranger himself had a deep tinge of negro
blood.  On hearing this sudden question, the Ethiopian
appeared to change his skin, its yellow hue becoming a ghastly
white, while, shaking and stammering, he thus replied:
</p>

<p>
"No! no!  There was no colored man!  It was an Irishman
that hanged him last night, at eight o'clock.  I came
away at seven!  His folks can't have looked for him in the
orchard yet."
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had the yellow man spoken, when he interrupted
himself, and, though he seemed weary enough before,
continued his journey at a pace which would have kept the
pedler's mare on a smart trot.  Dominicus stared after him
in great perplexity.  If the murder had not been committed
till Tuesday night, who was the prophet that had foretold
it, in all its circumstances, on Tuesday morning?  If
Mr. Higginbotham's corpse were not yet discovered by his own
family, how came the mulatto, at above thirty miles' distance,
to know that he was hanging in the orchard, especially as he
had left Kimballton before the unfortunate man was hanged
at all?  These ambiguous circumstances, with the stranger's
surprise and terror, made Dominicus think of raising a hue
and cry after him, as an accomplice in the murder; since a
murder, it seemed, had really been perpetrated.
</p>

<p>
"But let the poor devil go," thought the pedler.  "I don't
want his black blood on my head; and hanging the nigger
wouldn't unhang Mr. Higginbotham.  Unhang the old gentleman!
It's a sin, I know; but I should hate to have him
come to life a second time, and give me the lie!"
</p>

<p>
With these meditations, Dominicus Pike drove into the
street of Parker's Falls, which, as everybody knows, is as
thriving a village as three cotton factories and a slitting mill
can make it.  The machinery was not in motion, and but a
few of the shop doors unbarred, when he alighted in the
stable-yard of the tavern, and made it his first business to
order the mare four quarts of oats.  His second duty, of
course, was to impart Mr. Higginbotham's catastrophe to the
hostler.  He deemed it advisable, however, not to be too positive
as to the date of the direful fact, and also to be uncertain
whether it were perpetrated by an Irishman and a mulatto,
or by the son of Erin alone.  Neither did he profess to relate
it on his own authority, nor that of any one person; but
mentioned it as a report generally diffused.
</p>

<p>
The story ran through the town like fire among girdled
trees, and became so much the universal talk that nobody
could tell whence it had originated.  Mr. Higginbotham was
as well known at Parker's Falls as any citizen of the place,
being part owner of the slitting mill, and a considerable
stockholder in the cotton factories.  The inhabitants felt
their own prosperity interested in his fate.  Such was the
excitement that the "Parker's Falls Gazette" anticipated its
regular day of publication, and came out with half a form
of blank paper and a column of double pica emphasized
with capitals, and headed "HORRID MURDER OF
MR. HIGGINBOTHAM!"  Among other dreadful details, the printed
account described the mark of the cord round the dead man's
neck, and stated the number of thousand dollars of which
he had been robbed; there was much pathos also about the
affliction of his niece, who had gone from one fainting fit to
another, ever since her uncle was found hanging on the
St. Michael's pear-tree with his pockets inside out.  The village
poet likewise commemorated the young lady's grief in seventeen
stanzas of a ballad.  The selectmen held a meeting, and,
in consideration of Mr. Higginbotham's claims on the town,
determined to issue handbills, offering a reward of five
hundred dollars for the apprehension of his murderers, and the
recovery of the stolen property.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the whole population of Parker's Falls, consisting
of shopkeepers, mistresses of boarding-houses, factory
girls, mill men, and schoolboys, rushed into the street, and
kept up such a terrible loquacity as more than compensated
for the silence of the cotton-machines which refrained from
their usual din, out of respect to the deceased.  Had
Mr. Higginbotham cared about posthumous renown, his untimely
ghost would have exulted in this tumult.  Our friend Dominicus,
in his vanity of heart, forgot his intended precautions,
and, mounting on the town pump, announced himself as the
bearer of the authentic intelligence which had caused so
wonderful a sensation.  He immediately became the great
man of the moment, and had just begun a new edition of the
narrative, with a voice like a field preacher, when the mail
stage drove into the village street.  It had traveled all night,
and must have shifted horses at Kimballton at three in the
morning.
</p>

<p>
"Now we shall hear all the particulars," shouted the crowd.
</p>

<p>
The coach rumbled up to the piazza of the tavern,
followed by a thousand people; for if any man had been
minding his own business till then, he now left it at sixes and
sevens, to hear the news.  The pedler, foremost in the race,
discovered two passengers, both of whom had been startled
from a comfortable nap to find themselves in the centre of a
mob.  Every man assailing them with separate questions,
all propounded at once, the couple were struck speechless,
though one was a lawyer and the other a young lady.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Higginbotham!  Mr. Higginbotham!  Tell us the
particulars about old Mr. Higginbotham!" bawled the mob.
"What is the coroner's verdict?  Are the murderers
apprehended?  Is Mr. Higginbotham's niece come out of her
fainting fits?  Mr. Higginbotham!  Mr. Higginbotham!!"
</p>

<p>
The coachman said not a word, except to swear awfully
at the hostler for not bringing him a fresh team of horses.
The lawyer inside had generally his wits about him, even
when asleep; the first thing he did, after learning the cause
of the excitement, was to produce a large red pocketbook.
Meantime, Dominicus Pike, being an extremely polite young
man, and also suspecting that a female tongue would tell
the story as glibly as a lawyer's, had handed the lady out
of the coach.  She was a fine, smart girl, now wide-awake
and bright as a button, and had such a sweet, pretty mouth
that Dominicus would almost as lief have heard a love tale
from it as a tale of murder.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen and ladies," said the lawyer, to the shopkeepers,
the mill men, and the factory girls, "I can assure
you that some unaccountable mistake, or, more probably,
a wilful falsehood, maliciously contrived to injure
Mr. Higginbotham's credit, has excited this singular uproar.  We
passed through Kimballton at three o'clock this morning,
and most certainly should have been informed of the murder
had any been perpetrated.  But I have proof, nearly as
strong as Mr. Higginbotham's own oral testimony, in the
negative.  Here is a note, relating to a suit of his in the
Connecticut courts, which was delivered me from that
gentleman himself.  I find it dated at ten o'clock last evening."
</p>

<p>
So saying, the lawyer exhibited the date and signature
of the note, which irrefragably proved, either that this
perverse Mr. Higginbotham was alive when he wrote it, or&mdash;as
some deemed the more probable case of two doubtful ones&mdash;that
he was so absorbed in worldly business as to continue
to transact it, even after his death.  But unexpected
evidence was forthcoming.  The young lady, after listening to
the pedler's explanation, merely seized a moment to smooth
her gown and put her curls in order, and then appeared at
the tavern-door, making a modest signal to be heard.
</p>

<p>
"Good people," said she, "I am Mr. Higginbotham's niece."
</p>

<p>
A wondering murmur passed through the crowd, on beholding
her so rosy and bright; that same unhappy niece
whom they had supposed, on the authority of the "Parker's
Falls Gazette," to be lying at death's door in a fainting fit.
But some shrewd fellows had doubted, all along, whether a
young lady would be quite so desperate at the hanging of
a rich old uncle.
</p>

<p>
"You see," continued Miss Higginbotham, with a smile,
"that this strange story is quite unfounded, as to myself;
and I believe I may affirm it to be equally so in regard to my
dear uncle Higginbotham.  He has the kindness to give
me a home in his house, though I contribute to my own
support by teaching a school.  I left Kimballton this morning
to spend the vacation of commencement week with a friend,
about five miles from Parker's Falls.  My generous uncle,
when he heard me on the stairs, called me to his bedside,
and gave me two dollars and fifty cents, to pay my stage
fare, and another dollar for my extra expenses.  He then
laid his pocketbook under his pillow, shook hands with me,
and advised me to take some biscuit in my bag, instead of
breakfasting on the road.  I feel confident, therefore, that
I left my beloved relative alive, and trust that I shall find
him so on my return."
</p>

<p>
The young lady courtesied at the close of her speech,
which was so sensible and well-worded, and delivered with
such grace and propriety, that everybody thought her fit to
be Preceptress of the best Academy in the State.  But a
stranger would have supposed that Mr. Higginbotham was
an object of abhorrence at Parker's Falls, and that a
thanksgiving had been proclaimed for his murder, so excessive was
the wrath of the inhabitants on learning their mistake.  The
mill men resolved to bestow public honors on Dominicus
Pike, only hesitating whether to tar and feather him, ride
him on a rail, or refresh him with an ablution at the
town-pump on the top of which he had declared himself the bearer
of the news.  The selectmen, by advice of the lawyer, spoke
of prosecuting him for a misdemeanor, in circulating
unfounded reports, to the great disturbance of the peace of
the commonwealth.  Nothing saved Dominicus, either from
mob law or a court of justice, but an eloquent appeal made
by the young lady in his behalf.  Addressing a few words
of heartfelt gratitude to his benefactress, he mounted the
green cart and rode out of town, under a discharge of
artillery from the schoolboys, who found plenty of ammunition
in the neighboring clay-pits and mud-holes.  As he turned
his head, to exchange a farewell glance with Mr. Higginbotham's
niece, a ball, of the consistence of hasty-pudding,
hit him slap in the mouth, giving him a most grim aspect.
His whole person was so bespattered with the like filthy
missiles, that he had almost a mind to ride back and supplicate
for the threatened ablution at the town-pump; for, though
not meant in kindness, it would now have been a deed of
charity.
</p>

<p>
However, the sun shone bright on poor Dominicus, and
the mud, an emblem of all stains of undeserved opprobrium,
was easily brushed off when dry.  Being a funny rogue, his
heart soon cheered up; nor could he refrain from a hearty
laugh at the uproar which his story had excited.  The hand-bills
of the selectmen would cause the commitment of all the
vagabonds in the State; the paragraph in the "Parker's
Falls Gazette" would be reprinted from Maine to Florida,
and perhaps form an item in the London newspapers; and
many a miser would tremble for his money-bags and life,
on learning the catastrophe of Mr. Higginbotham.  The
pedler meditated with much fervor on the charms of the young
schoolmistress, and swore that Daniel Webster never spoke
nor looked so like an angel as Miss Higginbotham, while
defending him from the wrathful populace at Parker's Falls.
</p>

<p>
Dominicus was now on the Kimballton Turnpike, having
all along determined to visit that place, though business had
drawn him out of the most direct road from Morristown.  As
he approached the scene of the supposed murder, he
continued to revolve the circumstances in his mind, and was
astonished at the aspect which the whole case assumed.
Had nothing occurred to corroborate the story of the first
traveler, it might now have been considered as a hoax; but
the yellow man was evidently acquainted either with the
report or the fact; and there was a mystery in his dismayed
and guilty look on being abruptly questioned.  When, to
this singular combination of incidents, it was added that
the rumor tallied exactly with Mr. Higginbotham's character
and habits of life; and that he had an orchard, and a
St. Michael's pear-tree, near which he always passed at
nightfall; the circumstantial evidence appeared so strong that
Dominicus doubted whether the autograph produced by the
lawyer, or even the niece's direct testimony, ought to be
equivalent.  Making cautious inquiries along the road, the
pedler further learned that Mr. Higginbotham had in his
service an Irishman of doubtful character, whom he had hired
without a recommendation, on the score of economy.
</p>

<p>
"May I be hanged myself," exclaimed Dominicus Pike
aloud, on reaching the top of a lonely hill, "if I'll believe
old Higginbotham is unhanged till I see him with my own
eyes and hear it from his own mouth?  And as he's a real
shaver, I'll have the minister or some other responsible man
for an endorser."
</p>

<p>
It was growing dusk when he reached the toll-house on
Kimballton Turnpike, about a quarter of a mile from the
village of this name.  His little mare was fast bringing him
up with a man on horseback, who trotted through the gate
a few rods in advance of him, nodded to the toll-gatherer,
and kept on toward the village.  Dominicus was acquainted
with the toll-man, and while making change the usual
remarks on the weather passed between them.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," said the pedler, throwing back his whip-lash,
to bring it down like a feather on the mare's flank, "you have
not seen anything of old Mr. Higginbotham within a day or
two?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered the toll-gatherer.  "He passed the gate
just before you drove up, and yonder he rides now, if you
can see him through the dusk.  He's been to Woodfield this
afternoon, attending a sheriff's sale there.  The old man
generally shakes hands and has a little chat with me; but
to-night he nodded&mdash;as if to say, 'Charge my toll'&mdash;and
jogged on; for wherever he goes, he must always be home at
eight o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"So they tell me," said Dominicus.
</p>

<p>
"I never saw a man look so yellow and thin as the squire
does," continued the toll-gatherer.  "Says I to myself,
to-night, 'He's more like a ghost or an old mummy than good
flesh and blood.'"
</p>

<p>
The pedler strained his eyes through the twilight, and
could just discern the horseman, now far ahead on the
village road.  He seemed to recognize the rear of
Mr. Higginbotham; but through the evening shadows, and amid the
dust from the horse's feet, the figure appeared dim and
unsubstantial; as if the shape of the mysterious old man were
faintly molded of darkness and gray light.  Dominicus
shivered.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Higginbotham has come back from the other world,
by way of the Kimballton Turnpike," thought he.
</p>

<p>
He shook the reins and rode forward, keeping about the
same distance in the rear of the gray old shadow, till the
latter was concealed by a bend of the road.  On reaching
this point, the pedler no longer saw the man on horseback,
but found himself at the head of the village street, not far
from a number of stores and two taverns, clustered round
the meeting-house steeple.  On his left was a stone wall and
a gate, the boundary of a wood-lot, beyond which lay an
orchard, further still a mowing field, and last of all a
house.  These were the premises of Mr. Higginbotham,
whose dwelling stood beside the old highway, but had been
left in the background by the Kimballton Turnpike.  Dominicus
knew the place; and the little mare stopped short by
instinct; for he was not conscious of tightening the reins.
</p>

<p>
"For the soul of me, I can not get by this gate!" said he,
trembling.  "I never shall be my own again, till I see
whether Mr. Higginbotham is hanging on the St. Michael's
pear-tree!"
</p>

<p>
He leaped from the cart, gave the rein a turn around the
gate-post, and ran along the green path of the wood-lot, as
if Old Nick were chasing behind.  Just then the village clock
tolled eight, and as each deep stroke fell, Dominicus gave
a fresh bound and flew faster than before, till, dim in the
solitary centre of the orchard, he saw the fated pear-tree.
One great branch stretched from the old contorted trunk
across the path, and threw the darkest shadow on that one
spot.  But something seemed to struggle beneath the branch!
</p>

<p>
The pedler had never pretended to more courage than
befits a man of peaceable occupation, nor could he account
for his valor on this awful emergency.  Certain it is,
however, that he rushed forward, prostrated a sturdy Irishman
with the butt-end of his whip, and found&mdash;not indeed hanging
on the St. Michael's pear-tree, but trembling beneath it,
with a halter round his neck&mdash;the old identical Mr. Higginbotham!
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Higginbotham," said Dominicus, tremulously, "you're
an honest man, and I'll take your word for it.  Have you
been hanged or not?"
</p>

<p>
If the riddle be not already guessed, a few words will
explain the simple machinery by which this "coming event"
was made to "cast its shadow before."  Three men had plotted
the robbery and murder of Mr. Higginbotham; two of them,
successively, lost courage and fled, each delaying the crime
one night by their disappearance; the third was in the act
of perpetration, when a champion, blindly obeying the call
of fate, like the heroes of old romance, appeared in the
person of Dominicus Pike.
</p>

<p>
It only remains to say that Mr. Higginbotham took the
pedler into high favor, sanctioned his addresses to the pretty
schoolmistress, and settled his whole property on their children,
allowing themselves the interest.  In due time, the old
gentleman capped the climax of his favors by dying a Christian
death, in bed, since which melancholy event Dominicus
Pike has removed from Kimballton, and established a large
tobacco manufactory in my native village.

THE WHITE OLD MAID
</p>

<p class="t3">
By NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE
</p>

<p>
The moonbeams came through two deep and narrow
windows and showed a spacious chamber richly
furnished in an antique fashion.  From one lattice
the shadow of the diamond panes was thrown
upon the floor; the ghostly light through the other swept
upon a bed, falling between the heavy silken curtains and
illuminating the face of a young man.  But how quietly the
slumberer lay! how pale his features!  And how like a shroud
the sheet was wound about his frame!  Yes, it was a corpse in
its burial clothes.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the fixed features seemed to move with dark
emotion.  Strange fantasy!  It was but the shadow of the
fringed curtain waving between the dead face and the
moonlight as the door of the chamber opened and a girl stole
softly to the bedside.  Was there delusion in the moonbeams,
or did her gesture and her eye betray a gleam of triumph as
she bent over the pale corpse, pale as itself, and pressed her
living lips to the cold ones of the dead?  As she drew back
from that long kiss her features writhed as if a proud heart
were fighting with its anguish.  Again it seemed that the
features of the corpse had moved responsive to her own.
Still an illusion.  The silken curtains had waved a second
time between the dead face and the moonlight as another
fair young girl unclosed the door and glided ghostlike to the
bedside.  There the two maidens stood, both beautiful, with
the pale beauty of the dead between them.  But she who
had first entered was proud and stately, and the other a soft
and fragile thing.
</p>

<p>
"Away!" cried the lofty one.  "Thou hadst him living;
the dead is mine."
</p>

<p>
"Thine!" returned the other, shuddering.  "Well hast
thou spoken; the dead is thine."
</p>

<p>
The proud girl started and stared into her face with a
ghastly look, but a wild and mournful expression passed
across the features of the gentle one, and, weak and
helpless, she sank down on the bed, her head pillowed beside
that of the corpse and her hair mingling with his dark locks.
A creature of hope and joy, the first draft of sorrow had
bewildered her.
</p>

<p>
"Edith!" cried her rival.
</p>

<p>
Edith groaned as with a sudden compression of the heart,
and removing her cheek from the dead youth's pillow, she
stood upright, fearfully encountering the eyes of the lofty
girl.
</p>

<p>
"Wilt thou betray me?" said the latter, calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Till the dead bid me speak I will be silent," answered
Edith.  "Leave us alone together.  Go and live many years,
and then return and tell me of thy life.  He too will be here.
Then, if thou tellest of sufferings more than death, we will
both forgive thee."
</p>

<p>
"And what shall be the token?" asked the proud girl, as
if her heart acknowledged a meaning in these wild words.
</p>

<p>
"This lock of hair," said Edith, lifting one of the dark
clustering curls that lay heavily on the dead man's brow.
</p>

<p>
The two maidens joined their hands over the bosom of
the corpse and appointed a day and hour far, far in time to
come for their next meeting in that chamber.  The statelier
girl gave one deep look at the motionless countenance and
departed, yet turned again and trembled ere she closed the
door, almost believing that her dead lover frowned upon
her.  And Edith, too!  Was not her white form fading into
the moonlight?  Scorning her own weakness, she went forth
and perceived that a negro slave was waiting in the passage
with a waxlight, which he held between her face and his
own and regarded her, as she thought, with an ugly
expression of merriment.  Lifting his torch on high, the slave
lighted her down the staircase and undid the portal of the
mansion.  The young clergyman of the town had just
ascended the steps, and, bowing to the lady, passed in
without a word.
</p>

<p>
Years&mdash;many years&mdash;rolled on.  The world seemed new
again, so much older was it grown since the night when those
pale girls had clasped their hands across the bosom of the
corpse.  In the interval a lonely woman had passed from
youth to extreme age, and was known by all the town as the
"Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet."  A taint of insanity had
affected her whole life, but so quiet, sad, and gentle, so
utterly free from violence, that she was suffered to pursue
her harmless fantasies unmolested by the world with whose
business or pleasures she had naught to do.  She dwelt alone,
and never came into the daylight except to follow funerals.
Whenever a corpse was borne along the street, in sunshine,
rain, or snow, whether a pompous train of the rich and
proud thronged after it, or few and humble were the
mourners, behind them came the lonely woman in a long white
garment which the people called her shroud.  She took no
place among the kindred or the friends, but stood at the door
to hear the funeral prayer, and walked in the rear of the
procession as one whose earthly charge it was to haunt the
house of mourning and be the shadow of affliction and see
that the dead were duly buried.  So long had this been her
custom that the inhabitants of the town deemed her a part
of every funeral, as much as the coffin-pall or the very corpse
itself, and augured ill of the sinner's destiny unless the Old
Maid in the Winding-Sheet came gliding like a ghost behind.
Once, it is said, she affrighted a bridal-party with her pale
presence, appearing suddenly in the illuminated hall just as
the priest was uniting a false maid to a wealthy man before
her lover had been dead a year.  Evil was the omen to that
marriage.  Sometimes she stole forth by moonlight and
visited the graves of venerable integrity and wedded love and
virgin innocence, and every spot where the ashes of a kind
and faithful heart were moldering.  Over the hillocks of
those favored dead would she stretch out her arms with a
gesture as if she were scattering seeds, and many believed
that she brought them from the garden of Paradise, for the
graves which she had visited were green beneath the snow
and covered with sweet flowers from April to November.
Her blessing was better than a holy verse upon the tombstone.
Thus wore away her long, sad, peaceful, and
fantastic life till few were so old as she, and the people of later
generations wondered how the dead had ever been buried or
mourners had endured their grief without the Old Maid in
the Winding-Sheet.  Still years went on, and still she
followed funerals and was not yet summoned to her own
festival of death.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon the great street of the town was all alive
with business and bustle, though the sun now gilded only
the upper half of the church-spire, having left the house-tops
and loftiest trees in shadow.  The scene was cheerful and
animated in spite of the sombre shade between the high
brick buildings.  Here were pompous merchants in white
wigs and laced velvet, the bronzed faces of sea-captains, the
foreign garb and air of Spanish Creoles, and the disdainful
port of natives of Old England, all contrasted with the rough
aspect of one or two back-settlers negotiating sales of timber
from forests where ax had never sounded.  Sometimes a
lady passed, swelling roundly forth in an embroidered petticoat,
balancing her steps in high-heeled shoes and courtesying
with lofty grace to the punctilious obeisances of the
gentlemen.  The life of the town seemed to have its very centre
not far from an old mansion that stood somewhat back
from the pavement, surrounded by neglected grass, with a
strange air of loneliness rather deepened than dispelled by
the throng so near it.  Its site would have been suitably
occupied by a magnificent Exchange or a brick block lettered all
over with various signs, or the large house itself might have
made a noble tavern with the "King's Arms" swinging before
it and guests in every chamber, instead of the present solitude.
But, owing to some dispute about the right of inheritance,
the mansion had been long without a tenant, decaying from
year to year and throwing the stately gloom of its shadow
over the busiest part of the town.
</p>

<p>
Such was the scene, and such the time, when a figure
unlike any that have been described was observed at a
distance down the street.
</p>

<p>
"I spy a strange sail yonder," remarked a Liverpool
captain&mdash;"that woman in the long white garment."
</p>

<p>
The sailor seemed much struck by the object, as were
several others who at the same moment caught a glimpse of
the figure that had attracted his notice.  Almost immediately
the various topics of conversation gave place to
speculations in an undertone on this unwonted occurrence.
</p>

<p>
"Can there be a funeral so late this afternoon?" inquired
some.
</p>

<p>
They looked for the signs of death at every door&mdash;the
sexton, the hearse, the assemblage of black-clad relatives, all
that makes up the woful pomp of funerals.  They raised
their eyes, also, to the sun-gilded spire of the church, and
wondered that no clang proceeded from its bell, which had
always tolled till now when this figure appeared in the light of
day.  But none had heard that a corpse was to be borne to its
home that afternoon, nor was there any token of a funeral
except the apparition of the Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.
</p>

<p>
"What may this portend?" asked each man of his neighbor.
</p>

<p>
All smiled as they put the question, yet with a certain
trouble in their eyes, as if pestilence, or some other wide
calamity, were prognosticated by the untimely intrusion
among the living of one whose presence had always been
associated with death and woe.  What a comet is to the
earth was that sad woman to the town.  Still she moved on,
while the hum of surprise was hushed at her approach, and
the proud and the humble stood aside that her white
garment might not wave against them.  It was a long, loose
robe of spotless purity.  Its wearer appeared very old, pale,
emaciated, and feeble, yet glided onward without the
unsteady pace of extreme age.  At one point of her course a
little rosy boy burst forth from a door and ran with open
arms toward the ghostly woman, seeming to expect a kiss
from her bloodless lips.  She made a slight pause, fixing her
eye upon him with an expression of no earthly sweetness, so
that the child shivered and stood awestruck rather than
affrighted while the Old Maid passed on.  Perhaps her
garment might have been polluted even by an infant's touch;
perhaps her kiss would have been death to the sweet boy
within the year.
</p>

<p>
"She is but a shadow," whispered the superstitious.  "The
child put forth his arms and could not grasp her robe."
</p>

<p>
The wonder was increased when the Old Maid passed
beneath the porch of the deserted mansion, ascended the
moss-covered steps, lifted the iron knocker and gave three
raps.  The people could only conjecture that some old
remembrance, troubling her bewildered brain, had impelled the
poor woman hither to visit the friends of her youth&mdash;all gone
from their home long since, and forever, unless their ghosts
still haunted it, fit company for the Old Maid in the
Winding-Sheet.
</p>

<p>
An elderly man approached the steps, and, reverently
uncovering his gray locks, essayed to explain the matter.
</p>

<p>
"None, madam," said he, "have dwelt in this house these
fifteen years agone&mdash;no, not since the death of old Colonel
Fenwicke, whose funeral you may remember to have followed.
His heirs, being ill-agreed among themselves, have
let the mansion-house go to ruin."
</p>

<p>
The Old Maid looked slowly round with a slight gesture
of one hand and a finger of the other upon her lip, appearing
more shadow-like than ever in the obscurity of the porch.
But again she lifted the hammer, and gave, this time, a
single rap.  Could it be that a footstep was now heard coming
down the staircase of the old mansion which all conceived to
have been so long untenanted?  Slowly, feebly, yet heavily,
like the pace of an aged and infirm person, the step
approached, more distinct on every downward stair, till it
reached the portal.  The bar fell on the inside; the door was
opened.  One upward glance toward the church-spire, whence
the sunshine had just faded, was the last that the people saw
of the Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.
</p>

<p>
"Who undid the door?" asked many.
</p>

<p>
This question, owing to the depth of shadow beneath the
porch, no one could satisfactorily answer.  Two or three aged
men, while protesting against an inference which might be
drawn, affirmed that the person within was a negro, and bore
a singular resemblance to Old Cæsar, formerly a slave in the
house, but freed by death some thirty years before.
</p>

<p>
"Her summons has waked up a servant of the old family,"
said one, half seriously.
</p>

<p>
"Let us wait here," replied another; "more guests will
knock at the door anon.  But the gate of the graveyard
should be thrown open."
</p>

<p>
Twilight had overspread the town before the crowd began
to separate or the comments on this incident were exhausted.
One after another was wending his way homeward, when a
coach&mdash;no common spectacle in those days&mdash;drove slowly
into the street.  It was an old-fashioned equipage, hanging
close to the ground, with arms on the panels, a footman
behind, and a grave, corpulent coachman seated high in front,
the whole giving an idea of solemn state and dignity.  There
was something awful in the heavy rumbling of the wheels.
</p>

<p>
The coach rolled down the street, till, coming to the
gateway of the deserted mansion, it drew up, and the footman
sprang to the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Whose grand coach is this?" asked a very inquisitive
body.
</p>

<p>
The footman made no reply, but ascended the steps of
the old house, gave three taps with the iron hammer, and
returned to open the coach door.  An old man possessed of
the heraldic lore so common in that day examined the shield
of arms on the panel.
</p>

<p>
"Azure, a lion's head erased, between three flowers-de-luce,"
said he, then whispered the name of the family to
whom these bearings belonged.  The last inheritor of its
honors was recently dead, after a long residence amid the
splendor of the British court, where his birth and wealth
had given him no mean station.  "He left no child,"
continued the herald, "and these arms, being in a lozenge,
betoken that the coach appertains to his widow."
</p>

<p>
Further disclosures, perhaps, might have been made had
not the speaker been suddenly struck dumb by the stern eye
of an ancient lady who thrust forth her head from the coach
preparing to descend.  As she emerged, the people saw that
her dress was magnificent, and her figure dignified in spite
of age and infirmity&mdash;a stately ruin, but with a look at once
of pride and wretchedness.  Her strong and rigid features
had an awe about them unlike that of the white Old Maid,
but as of something evil.  She passed up the steps, leaning
on a gold-headed cane.  The door swung open as she
ascended, and the light of a torch glittered on the
embroidery of her dress and gleamed on the pillars of the
porch.  After a momentary pause, a glance backward and
then a desperate effort, she went in.
</p>

<p>
The decipherer of the coat-of-arms had ventured up the
lower step, and, shrinking back immediately, pale and tremulous,
affirmed that the torch was held by the very image of
Old Cæsar.
</p>

<p>
"But such a hideous grin," added he, "was never seen on
the face of mortal man, black or white.  It will haunt me
till my dying day."
</p>

<p>
Meantime, the coach had wheeled round with a prodigious
clatter on the pavement and rumbled up the street, disappearing
in the twilight, while the ear still tracked its course.
Scarcely was it gone when the people began to question
whether the coach and attendants, the ancient lady, the
spectre of Old Cæsar and the Old Maid herself were not all
a strangely combined delusion with some dark purport in
its mystery.  The whole town was astir, so that, instead
of dispersing, the crowd continually increased, and stood
gazing up at the windows of the mansion, now silvered by
the brightening moon.  The elders, glad to indulge the
narrative propensity of age, told of the long-faded splendor of.
the family, the entertainments they had given and the guests,
the greatest of the land, and even titled and noble ones from
abroad, who had passed beneath that portal.  These graphic
reminiscences seemed to call up the ghosts of those to whom
they referred.  So strong was the impression on some of the
more imaginative hearers that two or three were seized with
trembling fits at one and the same moment, protesting that
they had distinctly heard three other raps of the iron
knocker.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" exclaimed others.  "See!  The moon shines
beneath the porch, and shows every part of it except in the
narrow shade of that pillar.  There is no one there."
</p>

<p>
"Did not the door open?" whispered one of these fanciful
persons.
</p>

<p>
"Didst thou see it too?" said his companion, in a startled
tone.
</p>

<p>
But the general sentiment was opposed to the idea that
a third visitant had made application at the door of the
deserted house.  A few, however, adhered to this new marvel,
and even declared that a red gleam like that of a torch had
shone through the great front window, as if the negro were
lighting a guest up the staircase.  This too was pronounced
a mere fantasy.
</p>

<p>
But at once the whole multitude started, and each
man beheld his own terror painted in the faces of all the
rest.
</p>

<p>
"What an awful thing is this!" cried they.
</p>

<p>
A shriek, too fearfully distinct for doubt, had been heard
within the mansion, breaking forth suddenly and succeeded
by a deep stillness, as if a heart had burst in giving it
utterance.  The people knew not whether to fly from the very
sight of the house or to rush trembling in and search out the
strange mystery.  Amid their confusion and affright they
were somewhat reassured by the appearance of their
clergyman, a venerable patriarch, and equally a saint, who had
taught them and their fathers the way to heaven for more
than the space of an ordinary lifetime.  He was a reverend
figure with long white hair upon his shoulders, a white beard
upon his breast, and a back so bent over his staff that he
seemed to be looking downward continually, as if to choose
a proper grave for his weary frame.  It was some time
before the good old man, being deaf and of impaired intellect,
could be made to comprehend such portions of the affair as
were comprehensible at all.  But when possessed of the
facts, his energies assumed unexpected vigor.
</p>

<p>
"Verily," said the old gentleman, "it will b$ fitting that
I enter the mansion-house of the worthy Colonel Fenwicke;
lest any harm should have befallen that true Christian
woman whom ye call the 'Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.'"
</p>

<p>
Behold, then, the venerable clergyman ascending the steps
of the mansion with a torch-bearer behind him.  It was the
elderly man who had spoken to the Old Maid, and the same
who had afterward explained the shield of arms and recognized
the features of the negro.  Like their predecessors,
they gave three raps with the iron hammer.
</p>

<p>
"Old Cæsar cometh not," observed the priest.  "Well, I
wot he no longer doth service in this mansion."
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly, then, it was something worse in Old Cæsar's
likeness," said the other adventurer.
</p>

<p>
"Be it as God wills," answered the clergyman.  "See! my
strength, though it be much decayed, hath sufficed to,
open this heavy door.  Let us enter and pass up the staircase."
</p>

<p>
Here occurred a singular exemplification of the dreamy
state of a very old man's mind.  As they ascended the wide
flight of stairs the aged clergyman appeared to move with
caution, occasionally standing aside, and oftener bending his
head, as it were in salutation, thus practising all the gestures
of one who makes his way through a throng.  Reaching the
head of the staircase, he looked around with sad and solemn
benignity, laid aside his staff, bared his hoary locks, and
was evidently on the point of commencing a prayer.
</p>

<p>
"Reverend sir," said his attendant, who conceived this
a very suitable prelude to their further search, "would it
not be well that the people join with us in prayer?"
</p>

<p>
"Well-a-day!" cried the old clergyman, staring strangely
around him.  "Art thou here with me, and none other?
Verily, past times were present to me, and I deemed that
I was to make a funeral prayer, as many a time heretofore,
from the head of this staircase.  Of a truth, I saw the shades
of many that are gone.  Yea, I have prayed at their burials,
one after another, and the Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet
hath seen them to their graves."
</p>

<p>
Being now more thoroughly awake to their present purpose,
he took his staff and struck forcibly on the floor, till
there came an echo from each deserted chamber, but no
menial to answer their summons.  They, therefore, walked
along the passage, and again paused, opposite to the great
front window, through which was seen the crowd in the
shadow and partial moonlight of the street beneath.  On
the right hand was the open door of a chamber, and a closed
one on their left.
</p>

<p>
The clergyman pointed his cane to the carved oak panel
of the latter.
</p>

<p>
"Within that chamber," observed he, "a whole lifetime
since, did I sit by the deathbed of a goodly young man who,
being now at the last gasp&mdash;"  Apparently, there was some
powerful excitement in the ideas which had now flashed
across his mind.  He snatched the torch from his companion's
hand, and threw open the door with such sudden violence
that the flame was extinguished, leaving them no other light
than the moonbeams which fell through two windows into
the spacious chamber.  It was sufficient to discover all that
could be known.  In a high-backed oaken armchair, upright,
with her hands clasped across her breast and her head
thrown back, sat the Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.  The
stately dame had fallen on her knees with her forehead on
the holy knees of the Old Maid, one hand upon the floor and
the other pressed convulsively against her heart.  It clutched
a lock of hair&mdash;once sable, now discolored with a greenish
mold.
</p>

<p>
As the priest and layman advanced into the chamber the
Old Maid's features assumed such a semblance of shifting
expression that they trusted to hear the whole mystery
explained by a single word.  But it was only the shadow of
a tattered curtain waving between the dead face and the
moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"Both dead!" said the venerable man.  "Then who shall
divulge the secret?  Methinks it glimmers to and fro in my
mind like the light and shadow across the Old Maid's face.
And now 'tis gone!"

WANDERING WILLIE'S TALE
</h3>

<p class="t3">
BY SIR WAITER SCOTT
</p>

<p class="intro">
<i>Sir Walter Scott, born in Edinburgh in
1771 and died at "Abbotsford" in 1832,
published the first of his Waverley Novels
("Waverley") in 1814.  "Redgauntlet," in
which "Wandering Willie's Tale" occurs,
appeared in 1824.  Wandering Willie, who
tells the tale, is Willie Steenson, a blind
fiddler devoted to the Redgauntlet family.
Many critics consider this the finest story in
the English language.  Andrew Lang, who
calls it "immortal," describes ft as "that
perfect model of a 'conte' in whose narrow range
humor, poetry, the grotesque, the terrible
are combined as in no other work of man."</i>

WANDERING WILLIE'S TALE
</p>

<p class="t3">
By SIR WALTER SCOTT
</p>

<p>
Ye maun have heard of Sir Robert Redgauntlet of
that Ilk, who lived in these parts before the dear
years.  The country will lang mind him; and our
fathers used to draw breath thick if ever they heard
him named.  He was out wi' the Hielandmen in Montrose's
time; and again he was in the hills wi' Glencairn in the
saxteen hundred and fifty-twa; and sae when King Charles the
Second came in, wha was in sic favor as the Laird of
Redgauntlet?  He was knighted at Lonon court, wi' the King's
ain sword; and being a red-hot prelatist, he came down here,
rampauging like a lion, with commissions of lieutenancy
(and of lunacy, for what I ken), to put down a' the Whigs
and Covenanters in the country.  Wild wark they made of
it; for the Whigs were as dour as the Cavaliers were fierce,
and it was which should first tire the other.  Redgauntlet was
aye for the strong hand; and his name is kenn'd as wide in
the country as Claverhouse's or Tam Dalyell's.  Glen, nor
dargle, nor mountain, nor cave could hide the puir Hill-folk
when Redgauntlet was out with bugle and bloodhound after
them, as if they had been sae mony deer.  And troth when
they fand them, they didna mak muckle mair ceremony
than a Hielandman wi' a roebuck.  It was just, "Will ye tak
the test?"  If not, "Make ready&mdash;present&mdash;fire!" and there
lay the recusant.
</p>

<p>
Far and wide was Sir Robert hated and feared.  Men
thought he had a direct compact with Satan; that he was
proof against steel, and that bullets happed aff his buff-coat
like hailstanes from a hearth; that he had a mear that would
turn a hare on the side of Carrifra Gauns&mdash;and muckle to the
same purpose, of whilk mair anon.  The best blessing they
wared on him was, "Deil scowp wi' Redgauntlet!"  He wasna
a bad maister to his ain folk though, and was weel aneugh
liked by his tenants; and as for the lackies and troopers that
raid out wi' him to the persecutions, as the Whigs ca'd those
killing times, they wad hae drunken themsells blind to his
health at ony time.
</p>

<p>
Now you are to ken that my gudesire lived on Redgauntlet's
grund; they ca' the place Primrose Knowe.  We had
lived on the grund, and under the Redgauntlets, since the
riding days, and lang before.  It was a pleasant bit; and I
think the air is callerer and fresher there than onywhere else
in the country.  It's a' deserted now; and I sat on the broken
door-cheek three days since, and was glad I couldna see the
plight the place was in; but that's a' wide o' the mark.  There
dwelt my gudesire, Steenie Steenson, a rambling, rattling
chiel he had been in his young days, and could play weel on
the pipes; he was famous at "Hoopers and Girders," a'
Cumberland couldna touch him at "Jockie Lattin," and he
had the finest finger for the backlilt between Berwick and
Carlisle.  The like o' Steenie wasna the sort that they made
Whigs o'.  And so he became a Tory, as they ca' it, which
we now ca' Jacobites, just out of a kind of needcessity, that
he might belang to some side or other.  He had nae ill-will
to the Whig bodies, and liked little to see the blude rin,
though being obliged to follow Sir Robert in hunting and
hosting, watching and warding, he saw muckle mischief, and
maybe did some, that he couldna avoid.
</p>

<p>
Now Steenie was a kind of favorite with his master, and
kenn'd a' the folks about the castle, and was often sent for
to play the pipes when they were at their merriment.  Auld
Dougal MacCallum, the butler, that had followed Sir Robert
through gude and ill, thick and thin, pool and stream, was
specially fond of the pipes, and aye gae my gudesire his
gude word wi' the laird; for Dougal could turn his master
round his finger.
</p>

<p>
Weel, round came the Revolution, and it had like to
have broken the hearts baith of Dougal and his master.  But
the change was not a'thegither sae great as they feared, and
other folk thought for.  The Whigs made an unco crawing
what they wad do with their auld enemies, and in special
wi' Sir Robert Redgauntlet.  But there were ower mony
great folks dipped in the same doings to mak a spick
span new warld.  So Parliament passed it a' ower easy; and
Sir Robert, bating that he was held to hunting foxes instead
of Covenanters, remained just the man he was.  His revel
was as loud, and his hall as weel lighted, as ever it had been,
though maybe he lacked the fines of the Nonconformists,
that used to come to stock his larder and cellar; for it is
certain he began to be keener about the rents than his
tenants used to find him before, and they behoved to be
prompt to the rent-day, or else the laird wasna pleased.  And
he was sic an awsome body that naebody cared to anger him;
for the oaths he swore, and the rage that he used to get
into, and the looks that he put on, made men sometimes
think him a devil incarnate.
</p>

<p>
Weel, my gudesire was nae manager&mdash;no that he was a
very great misguider&mdash;but he hadna the saving gift, and he
got twa terms' rent in arrear.  He got the first brash at
Whitsunday put ower wi' fair word and piping; but when
Martinmas came, there was a summons from the grund-officer
to come wi' the rent on a day preceese, or else Steenie
behoved to flit.  Sair wark he had to get the siller; but he
was weel-freended, and at last he got the haill scraped
thegither&mdash;a thousand merks; the maist of it was from a
neighbor they ca'd Laurie Lapraik&mdash;a sly tod.  Laurie had walth
o' gear&mdash;could hunt wi' the hound and rin wi' the hare&mdash;and
be Whig or Tory, saunt or sinner, as the wind stood.  He
was a professor in this Revolution warld; but he liked an
orra sough of this warld, and a tune on the pipes weel
aneugh at a bytime; and abune a' he thought he had gude
security for the siller he lent my gudesire ower the stocking
at Primrose Knowe.
</p>

<p>
Away trots my gudesire to Redgauntlet Castle, wi' a heavy
purse and a light heart, glad to be out of the laird's danger.
Weel, the first thing he learned at the castle was that Sir
Robert had fretted himsell into a fit of the gout, because he
did not appear before twelve o'clock.  It wasna a'thegither
for sake of the money, Dougal thought; but because he didna
like to part wi' my gudesire aff the grund.  Dougal was
glad to see Steenie, and brought him into the great oak
parlor, and there sat the laird his leesome lane, excepting that
he had beside him a great ill-favored jackanape, that was a
special pet of his&mdash;a cankered beast it was, and mony an
ill-natured trick it played; ill to please it was, and easily
angered&mdash;ran about the haill castle, chattering and yowling,
and pinching and biting folk, especially before ill weather,
or disturbances in the state.  Sir Robert ca'd it Major Weir,
after the warlock that was burnt;* and few folk liked either
the name or the conditions of the creature&mdash;they thought
there was something in it by ordinar&mdash;and my gudesire was
not just easy in mind when the door shut on him, and he
saw himself in the room wi' naebody but the laird, Dougal
MacCallum, and the major, a thing that hadna chanced to
him before.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* A celebrated wizard, executed (1670) at Edinburgh for sorcery and other
crimes.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Sir Robert sat, or, I should say, lay, in a great armed
chair, wi' his grand velvet gown, and his feet on a cradle;
for he had baith gout and gravel, and his face looked as gash
and ghastly as Satan's.  Major Weir sat opposite to him, in
a red laced coat, and the laird's wig on his head; and aye as
Sir Robert girned wi' pain, the jackanape girned too, like a
sheep's-head between a pair of tangs&mdash;an ill-faured, fearsome
couple they were.  The laird's buff-coat was hung on
a pin behind him, and his broadsword and his pistols within
reach; for he keepit up the auld fashion of having the
weapons ready, and a horse saddled day and night, just as he
used to do when he was able to loup on horseback, and away
after ony of the Hill-folk he could get speerings of.  Some
said it was for fear of the Whigs taking vengeance, but I
judge it was just his auld custom&mdash;he wasna gien to fear
onything.  The rental-book, wi' its black cover and brass clasps,
was lying beside him; and a book of sculduggery sangs was
put betwixt the leaves, to keep it open at the place where it
bore evidence against the goodman of Primrose Knowe, as
behind the hand with his mails and duties.  Sir Robert gave
my gudesire a look as if he would have withered his heart
in his bosom.  Ye maun ken he had a way of bending his
brows that men saw the visible mark of a horseshoe in his
forehead, deep-dinted, as if it had been stamped there.
</p>

<p>
"Are ye come light-handed, ye son of a toom whistle?"
said Sir Robert.  "Zounds! if you are&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
My gudesire, with as gude a countenance as he could
put on, made a leg, and placed the bag of money on the
table wi' a dash, like a man that does something clever.
The laird drew it to him hastily.  "Is it all here, Steenie,
man?"
</p>

<p>
"Your honor will find it right," said my gudesire.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Dougal," said the laird, "gie Steenie a tass of
brandy downstairs, till I count the siller and write the
receipt."
</p>

<p>
But they werena weel out of the room when Sir Robert
gied a yelloch that garr'd the castle rock.  Back ran Dougal&mdash;in
flew the livery-men&mdash;yell on yell gied the laird, ilk ane
mair awfu' than the ither.  My gudesire knew not whether
to stand or flee, but he ventured back into the parlor, where
a' was gaun hirdie-girdie&mdash;naebody to say "come in" or "gae
out."  Terribly the laird roared for cauld water to his feet,
and wine to cool his throat; and "Hell, hell, hell, and its
flames," was aye the word in his mouth.  They brought him
water, and when they plunged his swoln feet into the tub, he
cried out it was burning; and folk say that it did bubble
and sparkle like a seething caldron.  He flung the cup at
Dougal's head, and said he had given him blood instead of
burgundy; and, sure aneugh, the lass washed clotted blood
aff the carpet the neist day.  The jackanape they ca'd Major
Weir, it jibbered and cried as if it was mocking its master.
My gudesire's head was like to turn: he forgot baith siller
and receipt, and downstairs he banged; but as he ran, the
shrieks came faint and fainter; there was a deep-drawn shivering
groan, and word gaed through the castle that the laird
was dead.
</p>

<p>
Weel, away came my gudesire wi' his finger in his mouth,
and his best hope was that Dougal had seen the moneybag,
and heard the laird speak of writing the receipt.  The
young laird, now Sir John, came from Edinburgh to see
things put to rights.  Sir John and his father never gree'd
weel.  Sir John had been bred an advocate, and afterward
sat in the last Scots Parliament and voted for the Union,
having gotten, it was thought, a rug of the compensations;
if his father could have come out of his grave he would have
brained him for it on his awn hearthstane.  Some thought
it was easier counting with the auld rough knight than the
fair-spoken young ane&mdash;but mair of that anon.
</p>

<p>
Dougal MacCallum, poor body, neither grat nor graned,
but gaed about the house looking like a corpse, but directing,
as was his duty, a' the order of the grand funeral.  Now,
Dougal looked aye waur and waur when night was coming, and
was aye the last to gang to his bed, whilk was in a little round
just opposite the chamber of dais, whilk his master occupied
while he was living, and where he now lay in state, as they
ca'd it, weel-a-day!  The night before the funeral, Dougal
could keep his awn counsel nae langer: he came doun with
his proud spirit, and fairly asked auld Hutcheon to sit in
his room with him for an hour.  When they were in the
round, Dougal took ae tass of brandy to himsell and gave
another to Hutcheon, and wished him all health and lang
life, and said that, for himsell, he wasna lang for this world;
for that, every night since Sir Robert's death, his silver call
had sounded from the state chamber, just as it used to do at
nights in his lifetime, to call Dougal to help to turn him in
his bed.  Dougal said that, being alone with the dead on
that floor of the tower (for naebody cared to wake Sir
Robert Redgauntlet like another corpse), he had never daured
to answer the call, but that now his conscience checked him
for neglecting his duty; for, "though death breaks service,"
said MacCallum, "it shall never break my service to Sir
Robert; and I will answer his next whistle, so be you will
stand by me, Hutcheon."
</p>

<p>
Hutcheon had nae will to work, but he had stood by
Dougal in battle and broil, and he wad not fail him at this
pinch; so down the carles sat ower a stoup of brandy, and
Hutcheon, who was something of a clerk, would have read a
chapter of the Bible; but Dougal would hear naething but
a blaud of Davie Lindsay, whilk was the waur preparation.
</p>

<p>
When midnight came, and the house was quiet as the
grave, sure aneugh the silver whistle sounded as sharp and
shrill as if Sir Robert was blowing it, and up gat the twa
auld serving-men and tottered into the room where the dead
man lay.  Hutcheon saw aneugh at the first glance; for
there were torches in the room, which showed him the foul
fiend in his ain shape, sitting on the laird's coffin!  Ower
he couped as if he had been dead.  He could not tell how
lang he lay in a trance at the door, but when he gathered
himsell he cried on his neighbor, and getting nae answer,
raised the house, when Dougal was found lying dead within
twa steps of the bed where his master's coffin was placed.
As for the whistle, it was gaen anes and aye; but mony a
time was it heard at the top of the house on the bartizan,
and amang the auld chimneys and turrets, where the howlets
have their nests.  Sir John hushed the matter up, and the
funeral passed over without mair bogle-wark.
</p>

<p>
But when a' was ower, and the laird was beginning to
settle his affairs, every tenant was called up for his arrears,
and my gudesire for the full sum that stood him in the
rental-book.  Weel, away he trots to the castle, to tell his
story, and there he is introduced to Sir John, sitting in his
father's chair, in deep mourning, with weepers and hanging
cravat, and a small walking rapier by his side, instead of the
auld broadsword that had a hundredweight of steel about it,
what with blade, chape, and basket-hilt.  I have heard their
communing so often tauld ower, that I almost think I was
there mysell, though I couldna be born at the time.  (In fact,
Alan, my companion mimicked, with a good deal of humor,
the flattering, conciliating tone of the tenant's address, and
the hypocritical melancholy of the laird's reply.  His
grandfather, he said, had, while he spoke, his eye fixed on the
rental-book, as if it were a mastiff-dog that he was afraid
would spring up and bite him.)
</p>

<p>
"I wuss ye joy, sir, of the head seat, and the white loaf,
and the braid lairdship.  Your father was a kind man to
friends and followers; muckle grace to you, Sir John, to fill
his shoon&mdash;his boots, I suld say, for he seldom wore shoon,
unless it were muils when he had the gout."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Steenie," quoth the laird, sighing deeply, and
putting his napkin to his een, "his was a sudden call, and he
will be missed in the country; no time to set his house in
order: weel prepared Godward, no doubt, which is the root
of the matter, but left us behind a tangled hesp to wind,
Steenie.  Hem! hem!  We maun go to business, Steenie;
much to do, and little time to do it in."
</p>

<p>
Here he opened the fatal volume.  I have heard of a
thing they call Doomsday Book&mdash;I am clear it has been a
rental of back-ganging tenants.
</p>

<p>
"Stephen," said Sir John, still in the same soft, sleekit
tone of voice&mdash;"Stephen Stevenson, or Steenson, ye are down
here for a year's rent behind the hand, due at last term."
</p>

<p>
Stephen.  "Please your honor, Sir John, I paid it to your
father."
</p>

<p>
Sir John.  "Ye took a receipt then, doubtless, Stephen, and
can produce it?"
</p>

<p>
Stephen.  "Indeed I hadna time, an it like your honor; for
nae sooner had I set doun the siller, and just as his honor
Sir Robert, that's gaen, drew it till him to count it, and write
out the receipt, he was ta'en wi' the pains that removed him."
</p>

<p>
"That was unlucky," said Sir John, after a pause.  "But
ye maybe paid it in the presence of somebody.  I want but a
talis qualis evidence, Stephen.  I would go ower strictly to
work with no poor man."
</p>

<p>
Stephen.  "Troth, Sir John, there was naebody in the
room but Dougal MacCallum, the butler.  But, as your honor
kens, he has e'en followed his auld master."
</p>

<p>
"Very unlucky again, Stephen," said Sir John, without
altering his voice a single note.  "The man to whom ye paid
the money is dead; and the man who witnessed the payment
is dead too; and the siller, which should have been to the
fore, is neither seen nor heard tell of in the repositories.
How am I to believe a' this?"
</p>

<p>
Stephen.  "I dinna ken, your honor; but there is a bit
memorandum note of the very coins&mdash;for, God help me!  I had to
borrow out of twenty purses&mdash;and I am sure that ilka man
there set down will take his grit oath for what purpose I
borrowed the money."
</p>

<p>
Sir John.  "I have little doubt ye borrowed the money,
Steenie.  It is the payment to my father that I want to have
some proof of."
</p>

<p>
Stephen.  "The siller maun be about the house, Sir John.
And since your honor never got it, and his honor that was
canna have ta'en it wi' him, maybe some of the family may
have seen it."
</p>

<p>
Sir John.  "We will examine the servants, Stephen; that
is but reasonable."
</p>

<p>
But lackey and lass, and page and groom, all denied
stoutly that they had ever seen such a bag of money as my
gudesire described.  What was waur, he had unluckily not
mentioned to any living soul of them his purpose of paying
his rent.  Ae quean had noticed something under his arm,
but she took it for the pipes.
</p>

<p>
Sir John Redgauntlet ordered the servants out of the
room, and then said to my gudesire: "Now, Steenie, ye see
you have fair play; and, as I have little doubt ye ken better
where to find the siller than any other body, I beg, in fair
terms, and for your own sake, that you will end this fasherie;
for, Stephen, ye maun pay or flit."
</p>

<p>
"The Lord forgie your opinion," said Stephen, driven
almost to his wit's-end&mdash;"I am an honest man."
</p>

<p>
"So am I, Stephen," said his honor; "and so are all the
folks in the house, I hope.  But if there be a knave among
us, it must be he that tells the story he can not prove."  He
paused, and then added, mair sternly: "If I understand your
trick, sir, you want to take advantage of some malicious
reports concerning things in this family, and particularly
respecting my father's sudden death, thereby to cheat me out
of the money, and perhaps take away my character, by
insinuating that I have received the rent I am demanding.
Where do you suppose this money to be?  I insist upon
knowing."
</p>

<p>
My gudesire saw everything look sae muckle against him
that he grew nearly desperate; however, he shifted from one
foot to another, looked to every corner of the room, and
made no answer.
</p>

<p>
"Speak out, sirrah," said the laird, assuming a look of his
father's&mdash;a very particular ane, which he had when he was
angry: it seemed as if the wrinkles of his frown made that
selfsame fearful shape of a horse's shoe in the middle of his
brow&mdash;"speak out, sir!  I will know your thoughts.  Do you
suppose that I have this money?"
</p>

<p>
"Far be it frae me to say so," said Stephen.
</p>

<p>
"Do you charge any of my people with having taken it?"
</p>

<p>
"I wad be laith to charge them that may be innocent,"
said my gudesire; "and if there be any one that is guilty, I
have nae proof."
</p>

<p>
"Somewhere the money must be, if there is a word of
truth in your story," said Sir John; "I ask where you think
it is, and demand a correct answer?"
</p>

<p>
"In hell, if you will have my thoughts of it," said my
gudesire, driven to extremity&mdash;"in hell! with your father, his
jackanape, and his silver whistle."
</p>

<p>
Down the stairs he ran, for the parlor was nae place for
him after such a word, and he heard the laird swearing blood
and wounds behind him, as fast as ever did Sir Robert, and
roaring for the bailie and the baron-officer.
</p>

<p>
Away rode my gudesire to his chief creditor, him they
ca'd Laurie Lapraik, to try if he could make onything out
of him; but when he tauld his story, he got but the warst
word in his wame&mdash;thief, beggar, and dyvour were the safest
terms; and to the boot of these hard terms, Laurie brought
up the auld story of his dipping his hand in the blood of
God's saunts, just as if a tenant could have helped riding with
the laird, and that a laird like Sir Robert Redgauntlet.  My
gudesire was by this time far beyond the bounds of patience,
and while he and Laurie were at deil speed the liars, he was
wanchancie aneugh to abuse Lapraik's doctrine as weel as
the man, and said things that garr'd folks' flesh grue that
heard them; he wasna just himsell, and he had lived wi' a
wild set in his day.
</p>

<p>
At last they parted, and my gudesire was to ride hame
through the wood of Pitmurkie, that is a' fou of black firs,
as they say.  I ken the wood, but the firs may be black or
white for what I can tell.  At the entry of the wood there is
a wild common, and on the edge of the common a little
lonely change-house, that was keepit then by a
hostler-wife&mdash;they suld hae ca'd her Tibbie Faw&mdash;and there puir Steenie
cried for a mutchkin of brandy, for he had had no refreshment
the haill day.  Tibbie was earnest wi' him to take a
bite o' meat, but he couldna think o't, nor would he take his
foot out of the stirrup, and took off the brandy wholly at twa
drafts, and named a toast at each&mdash;the first was, the
memory of Sir Robert Redgauntlet, and might he never lie
quiet in his grave till he had righted his poor bond-tenant;
and the second was, a health to Man's Enemy, if he would
but get him back the pock of siller, or tell him what came o't,
for he saw the haill world was like to regard him as a thief
and a cheat, and he took that waur than even the ruin of his
house and hauld.
</p>

<p>
On he rode, little caring where.  It was a dark night
turned, and the trees made it yet darker, and he let the beast
take its ain road through the wood; when, all of a sudden,
from tired and wearied that it was before, the nag began to
spring, and flee, and stend, that my gudesire could hardly
keep the saddle; upon the whilk, a horseman, suddenly riding
up beside him, said, "That's a mettle beast of yours, freend;
will you sell him?"  So saying, he touched the horse's neck
with his riding-wand, and it fell into its auld heigh-ho of a
stumbling trot.  "But his spunk's soon out of him, I think,"
continued the stranger, "and that is like mony a man's courage,
that thinks he wad do great things till he come to the
proof."
</p>

<p>
My gudesire scarce listened to this, but spurred his horse,
with "Gude e'en to you, freend."
</p>

<p>
But it's like the stranger was ane that doesna lightly yield
his point; for, ride as Steenie liked, he was aye beside him
at the salfsame pace.  At last my gudesire, Steenie Steenson,
grew half angry and, to say the truth, half feared.
</p>

<p>
"What is it that ye want with me, freend?" he said.  "If
ye be a robber, I have nae money; if ye be a leal man,
wanting company, I have nae heart to mirth or speaking; and if
ye want to ken the road, I scarce ken it mysell."
</p>

<p>
"If you will tell me your grief," said the stranger, "I am
one that, though I have been sair misca'd in the world, am
the only hand for helping my freends."
</p>

<p>
So my gudesire, to ease his ain heart, mair than from any
hope of help, told him the story from beginning to end.
</p>

<p>
"It's a hard pinch," said the stranger; "but I think I can
help you."
</p>

<p>
"If you could lend the money, sir, and take a lang day&mdash;I
ken nae other help on earth," said my gudesire.
</p>

<p>
"But there may be some under the earth," said the stranger.
"Come, I'll be frank wi' you; I could lend you the
money on bond, but you would maybe scruple my terms.
Now, I can tell you that your auld laird is disturbed in his
grave by your curses, and the wailing of your family, and
if ye daur venture to go to see him, he will give you the
receipt."
</p>

<p>
My gudesire's hair stood on end at this proposal, but he
thought his companion might be some humorsome chield that
was trying to frighten him, and might end with lending him
the money.  Besides, he was bauld wi' brandy, and desperate
wi' distress; and he said he had courage to go to the gate of
hell, and a step farther, for that receipt.
</p>

<p>
The stranger laughed.
</p>

<p>
Weel, they rode on through the thickest of the wood,
when, all of a sudden, the horse stopped at the door of a
great house; and, but that he knew the place was ten miles
off, my gudesire would have thought he was at Redgauntlet
Castle.  They rode into the outer courtyard, through the
muckle faulding yetts, and aneath the auld portcullis; and
the whole front of the house was lighted, and there were
pipes and fiddles, and as much dancing and deray within as
used to be in Sir Robert's house at Pace and Yule, and such
high seasons.  They lap off, and my gudesire, as seemed to
him, fastened his horse to the very ring he had tied him to
that morning, when he gaed to wait on the young Sir John.
</p>

<p>
"God!" said my gudesire, "if Sir Robert's death be but a
dream!"
</p>

<p>
He knocked at the ha' door just as he was wont, and his
auld acquaintance, Dougal MacCallum, just after his wont,
too, came to open the door, and said, "Piper Steenie, are ye
there, lad?  Sir Robert has been crying for you."
</p>

<p>
My gudesire was like a man in a dream; he looked for the
stranger, but he was gane for the time.  At last he just tried
to say, "Ha!  Dougal Driveower, are ye living?  I thought ye
had been dead."
</p>

<p>
"Never fash yoursell wi' me," said Dougal, "but look to
yoursell; and see ye tak naething frae onybody here, neither
meat, drink, or siller, except just the receipt that is your
ain."
</p>

<p>
So saying, he led the way out through halls and trances
that were weel kenn'd to my gudesire, and into the auld oak
parlor; and there was as much singing of profane sangs, and
birling of red wine, and speaking blasphemy and sculduddry,
as had ever been in Redgauntlet Castle when it was at the
blythest.
</p>

<p>
But, Lord take us in keeping! what a set of ghastly revelers
they were that sat round that table!  My gudesire kenn'd
mony that had long before gane to their place, for often had
he piped to the most part in the hall of Redgauntlet.  There
was the fierce Middleton, and the dissolute Rothes, and the
crafty Lauderdale; and Dalyell, with his bald head and a
beard to his girdle; and Earlshall, with Cameron's blude on
his hand; and wild Bonshaw, that tied blessed Mr. Cargill's
limbs till the blude sprung; and Dumbarton Douglas, the
twice-turned traitor baith to country and king.  There was
the Bluidy Advocate MacKenyie, who, for his worldly wit
and wisdom, had been to the rest as a god.  And there was
Claverhouse, as beautiful as when he lived, with his long
dark, curled locks, streaming down over his laced buff-coat,
and his left hand always on his right spule-blade, to hide the
wound that the silver bullet had made.  He sat apart from
them all, and looked at them with a melancholy, haughty
countenance; while the rest hallooed, and sung, and laughed,
that the room rang.  But their smiles were fearfully
contorted from time to time; and their laughter passed into such
wild sounds as made my gudesire's very nails grow blue, and
chilled the marrow in his banes.
</p>

<p>
They that waited at the table were just the wicked serving-men
and troopers that had done their work and cruel bidding
on earth.  There was the Lang Lad of the Nethertown, that
helped to take Argyle; and the bishop's summoner, that they
called the Deil's Rattle-bag; and the wicked guardsmen, in
their laced coats; and the savage Highland Amorites, that
shed blood like water; and mony a proud serving-man,
haughty of heart and bloody of hand, cringing to the rich,
and making them wickeder than they would be; grinding the
poor to powder, when the rich had broken them to fragments.
And mony, mony mair were coming and ganging, a' as busy in
their vocation as if they had been alive.
</p>

<p>
Sir Robert Redgauntlet, in the midst of a' this fearful riot,
cried, wi' a voice like thunder, on Steenie Piper to come to
the board-head where he was sitting, his legs stretched out
before him, and swathed up with flannel, with his holster
pistols aside him, while the great broadsword rested against his
chair, just as my gudesire had seen him the last time upon
earth&mdash;the very cushion for the jackanape was close to him,
but the creature itsell was not there; it wasna its hour, it's
likely; for he heard them say as he came forward, "Is not
the major come yet?"  And another answered, "The jackanape
will be here betimes the morn."  And when my gudesire
came forward, Sir Robert, or his ghaist, or the deevil in his
likeness, said, "Weel, piper, hae ye settled wi' my son for the
year's rent?"
</p>

<p>
With much ado my father gat breath to say that Sir John
would not settle without his honor's receipt.
</p>

<p>
"Ye shall hae that for a tune of the pipes, Steenie," said
the appearance of Sir Robert.  "Play us up, 'Weel noddled,
Luckie.'"
</p>

<p>
Now this was a tune my gudesire learned frae a warlock,
that heard it when they were worshiping Satan at their meetings,
and my gudesire had sometimes played it at the ranting
suppers in Redgauntlet Castle, but never very willingly; and
now he grew cauld at the very name of it, and said, for
excuse, he hadna his pipes wi' him.
</p>

<p>
"MacCallum, ye limb of Beelzebub," said the fearfu' Sir
Robert, "bring Steenie the pipes that I am keeping for him!"
</p>

<p>
MacCallum brought a pair of pipes might have served the
piper of Donald of the Isles.  But he gave my gudesire a
nudge as he offered them; and looking secretly and closely,
Steenie saw that the chanter was of steel, and heated to a
white heat; so he had fair warning not to trust his fingers
with it.  So he excused himself again, and said he was faint
and frightened, and had not wind enough to fill the bag.
</p>

<p>
"Then ye maun eat and drink, Steenie," said the figure;
"for we do little else here; and it's ill speaking between a
fou man and a fasting."
</p>

<p>
Now these were the very words that the bloody Earl of
Douglas said to keep the king's messenger in hand, while he
cut the head off MacLellan of Bombie, at the Threave Castle,
and that put Steenie mair and mair on his guard.  So he
spoke up like a man, and said he came neither to eat, or
drink, or make minstrelsy, but simply for his ain&mdash;to ken
what was come o' the money he had paid, and to get a discharge
for it; and he was so stout-hearted by this time, that
he charged Sir Robert for conscience' sake (he had no power
to say the holy name), and as he hoped for peace and rest,
to spread no snares for him, but just to give him his ain.
</p>

<p>
The appearance gnashed its teeth and laughed, but it took
from a large pocket-book the receipt, and handed it to
Steenie.  "There is your receipt, ye pitiful cur; and for the
money, my dog-whelp of a son may go look for it in the
Cat's Cradle."
</p>

<p>
My gudesire uttered mony thanks, and was about to retire
when Sir Robert roared aloud: "Stop though, thou
sack-doudling son of a whore!  I am not done with thee.  <i>Here</i>
we do nothing for nothing; and you must return on this very
day twelvemonth to pay your master the homage that you
owe me for my protection."
</p>

<p>
My father's tongue was loosed of a suddenty, and he said
aloud: "I refer mysell to God's pleasure, and not to yours."
</p>

<p>
He had no sooner uttered the word than all was dark
around him, and he sunk on the earth with such a sudden
shock that he lost both breath and sense.
</p>

<p>
How lang Steenie lay there, he could not tell; but when he
came to himsell, he was lying in the auld kirkyard of
Redgauntlet parochine, just at the door of the family aisle, and
the scutcheon of the auld knight, Sir Robert, hanging over
his head.  There was a deep morning fog on grass and gravestane
around him, and his horse was feeding quietly beside
the minister's twa cows.  Steenie would have thought the
whole was a dream, but he had the receipt in his hand, fairly
written and signed by the auld laird; only the last letters of
his name were a little disorderly, written like one seized with
sudden pain.
</p>

<p>
Sorely troubled in his mind, he left that dreary place, rode
through the mist to Redgauntlet Castle, and with much ado
he got speech of the laird.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you dyvour bankrupt," was the first word, "have
you brought me my rent?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered my gudesire, "I have not; but I have
brought your honor Sir Robert's receipt for it."
</p>

<p>
"How, sirrah?  Sir Robert's receipt!  You told me he had
not given you one."
</p>

<p>
"Will your honor please to see if that bit line is right?"
</p>

<p>
Sir John looked at every line, and at every letter, with
much attention, and at last at the date, which my gudesire
had not observed&mdash;"'From my appointed place,'" he read,
"'this twenty-fifth of November.'  What!  That is yesterday!
Villain, thou must have gone to Hell for this!"
</p>

<p>
"I got it from your honor's father; whether he be in
Heaven or Hell, I know not," said Steenie.
</p>

<p>
"I will delate you for a warlock to the privy council!" said
Sir John.  "I will send you to your master, the devil, with
the help of a tar-barrel and a torch!"
</p>

<p>
"I intend to delate mysell to the presbytery," said Steenie,
"and tell them all I have seen last night, whilk are things
fitter for them to judge of than a borrel man like me."
</p>

<p>
Sir John paused, composed himsell, and desired to hear the
full history; and my gudesire told it him from point to point,
as I have told it you&mdash;word for word, neither more nor less.
</p>

<p>
Sir John was silent again for a long time, and at last he
said, very composedly: "Steenie, this story of yours concerns
the honor of many a noble family besides mine; and if it be
a leasing-making, to keep yourself out of my danger, the least
you can expect is to have a red-hot iron driven through your
tongue, and that will be as bad as scauding your fingers with
a red-hot chanter.  But yet it may be true, Steenie; and if the
money cast up, I shall not know what to think of it.  But
where shall we find the Cat's Cradle?  There are cats enough
about the old house, but I think they kitten without the
ceremony of bed or cradle."
</p>

<p>
"We were best ask Hutcheon," said my gudesire; "he kens
a' the odd corners about as weel as&mdash;another serving-man that
is now gane, and that I wad not like to name."
</p>

<p>
Aweel, Hutcheon, when he was asked, told them that a
ruinous turret, lang disused, next to the clock-house, only
accessible by a ladder, for the opening was on the outside,
and far above the battlements, was called of old the Cat's
Cradle.
</p>

<p>
"There will I go immediately," said Sir John; and he
took (with what purpose, Heaven kens) one of his father's
pistols from the hall-table, where they had lain since the
night he died, and hastened to the battlements.
</p>

<p>
It was a dangerous place to climb, for the ladder was auld
and frail, and wanted ane or twa rounds.  However, up got
Sir John, and entered at the turret door, where his body
stopped the only little light that was in the bit turret.
Something flees at him wi' a vengeance, maist dang him back ower;
bang gaed the knight's pistol, and Hutcheon, that held the
ladder, and my gudesire that stood beside him, hears a loud
skelloch.  A minute after, Sir John flings the body of the
jackanape down to them, and cries that the siller is fund, and
that they should come up and help him.  And there was the
bag of siller sure aneugh, and mony orra things besides that
had been missing for mony a day.  And Sir John, when he
had riped the turret weel, led my gudesire into the
dining-parlor, and took him by the hand, and spoke kindly to him,
and said he was sorry he should have doubted his word, and
that he would hereafter be a good master to him, to make
amends.
</p>

<p>
"And now, Steenie," said Sir John, "although this vision
of yours tends, on the whole, to my father's credit, as an
honest man, that he should, even after his death, desire to see
justice done to a poor man like you, yet you are sensible that
ill-dispositioned men might make bad constructions upon it,
concerning his soul's health.  So, I think, we had better lay
the haill dirdum on that ill-deedie creature, Major Weir, and
say naething about your dream in the wood of Pitmurkie,
You had taken ower muckle brandy to be very certain about
onything; and, Steenie, this receipt (his hand shook while he
held it out), it's but a queer kind of document, and we will
do best, I think, to put it quietly in the fire."
</p>

<p>
"Od, but for as queer as it is, it's a' the voucher I have for
my rent," said my gudesire, who was afraid, it may be, of
losing the benefit of Sir Robert's discharge.
</p>

<p>
"I will bear the contents to your credit in the rental-book,
and give you a discharge under my own hand," said Sir John,
"and that on the spot.  And, Steenie, if you can hold your
tongue about this matter, you shall sit, from this term
downward, at an easier rent."
</p>

<p>
"Mony thanks to your honor," said Steenie, who saw easily
in what corner the wind was; "doubtless I will be conformable
to all your honor's commands; only I would willingly
speak wi' some powerful minister on the subject, for I do not
like the sort of summons of appointment whilk your honor's
father&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do not call the phantom my father!" said Sir John,
interrupting him.
</p>

<p>
"Weel, then, the thing that was so like him," said my
gudesire; "he spoke of my coming back to him this time
twelvemonth, and it's a weight on my conscience."
</p>

<p>
"Aweel, then," said Sir John, "if you be so much distressed
in mind, you speak to our minister of the parish; he is a
douce man, regards the honor of our family, and the mair
that he may look for some patronage from me."
</p>

<p>
Wi' that my gudesire readily agreed that the receipt
should be burned, and the laird threw it into the chimney
with his ain hand.  Burn it would not for them, though;
but away it flew up the lum, wi' a lang train of sparks at
its tail, and a hissing noise like a squib.
</p>

<p>
My gudesire gaed down to the manse, and the minister,
when he had heard the story, said it was his real opinion that,
though my gudesire had gaen very far in tampering with dangerous
matters, yet, as he had refused the devil's arles (for
such was the offer of meat and drink), and had refused to do
homage by piping at his bidding, he hoped, that if he held a
circumspect walk hereafter, Satan could take little advantage
by what was come and gane.  And, indeed, my gudesire, of
his ain accord, lang foreswore baith the pipes and the
brandy; it was not even till the year was out, and the fatal
day passed, that he would so much as take the fiddle, or
drink usquebaugh or tippenny.
</p>

<p>
Sir John made up his story about the jackanape as he liked
himsell; and some believe till this day there was no more in
the matter than the filching nature of the brute.  Indeed,
ye'll no hinder some to threap that it was nane o' the
Auld Enemy that Dougal and Hutcheon saw in the
laird's room, but only that wanchancie creature, the major,
capering on the coffin; and that, as to the blawing on the
laird's whistle that was heard after he was dead, the filthy
brute could do that as weel as the laird himsell, if no better.
But Heaven kens the truth, whilk first came out by the
minister's wife, after Sir John and her ain gudeman were baith
in the molds.  And then, my gudesire, wha was failed in his
limbs, but not in his judgment or memory&mdash;at least nothing
to speak of&mdash;was obliged to tell the real narrative to his
freends for the credit of his good name.  He might else have
been charged for a warlock.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The shades of evening were growing thicker around us as
my conductor finished his long narrative with this moral:
"Ye see, birkie, it is nae chancy thing to tak a stranger
traveler for a guide when ye are in an uncouth land."
</p>

<p>
"I should not have made that inference," said I.  "Your
grandfather's adventure was fortunate for himself, whom it
saved from ruin and distress; and fortunate for his landlord
also, whom it prevented from committing a gross act of
injustice."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, but they had baith to sup the sauce o't sooner or
later," said Wandering Willie.  "What was fristed wasna
forgiven.  Sir John died before he was much over threescore;
and it was just like of a moment's illness.  And for my
gudesire, though he departed in fulness of years, yet there was
my father, a yauld man of forty-five, fell down betwixt the
stilts of his pleugh, and raise never again, and left nae bairn
but me, a puir sightless, fatherless, motherless creature, could
neither work nor want.  Things gaed weel aneugh at first;
for Sir Redwald Redgauntlet, the only son of Sir John, and
the oye of auld Sir Robert, and, wae's me! the last of the
honorable house, took the farm off our hands, and brought
me into his household to have care of me.  He liked music,
and I had the best teachers baith England and Scotland
could gie me.  Mony a merry year was I wi' him; but wae's
me! he gaed out with other pretty men in the Forty-five&mdash;I'll
say nae mair about it.  My head never settled weel since
I lost him; and if I say another word about it, deil a bar
will I have the heart to play the night.  Look out, my gentle
chap," he resumed, in a different tone, "ye should see the
lights in Brokenburn Glen by this time."
